cardiovascular event was defined as a myocardial infarction mi a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ptca or stenting procedure or a coronary artery bypass graft cabg using ehr documented icd9 criteria . these studies have been small primarily nonrandomized trials . apheresis is a viable treatment for fh patients especially those that are statin intolerant due to its lipid lowering nature and its apparent reduction of cardiac events . thirty four cardiac events were documented before apheresis in 8 patients compared with 9 events in 5 patients after apheresis . lipid apheresis can reliably reduce ldl non hdl cholesterol triglyceride and total cholesterol levels in fh patients . although taken from a small study population our data suggests a reduction in cardiac event rate after apheresis . our data suggest that lipid apheresis shows a strong but not statistically significant trend towards the reduction of cardiac events . the patients self reported a total of 44 cardiac events before apheresis and 8 cardiac events after apheresis . lipid apheresis is an alternative form of treatment for these fh patients as well as those who have persistently elevated ldl levels despite treatment . patients were observed for an average of 7.6 5.9 years before apheresis and 6.2 4.7 years after apheresis with 60.6 total patient years before apheresis and 67.8 patient years after apheresis . while this study found that apheresis arrested the progression of atherosclerosis the fh regression study found that ldl apheresis combined with simvastatin was more effective than colestipol plus simvastatin in reducing ldl cholesterol and lipoprotein a but was less effective at influencing coronary atherosclerosis . by defining the observational period initial time point as the first documented ehr visit we excluded 20 events before apheresis and 2 events after apheresis from the cardiac event rate calculation . when used in conjunction with statins and other lipid lowering drugs lipid apheresis may also induce the regression of coronary atherosclerotic plaque in familial hypercholesterolemia fh patients . finally this study focused on active apheresis patients and therefore did not include patients who had stopped apheresis or were deceased . for many patients however statins are not a viable treatment option because of either intolerance or ineffectiveness . retrospective chart reviews were performed and questionnaire surveys were given to active lipid apheresis patients at the minneapolis heart institute mhi at abbott northwestern hospital anw minneapolis minnesota . of the 10 patients that completed the questionnaire 4 patients were currently on statins while the other 6 were statin intolerant . the ldl apheresis atherosclerosis regression study laars looked at the change in plaque characteristics of patients undergoing apheresis compared to drug therapy over a period of two years . four 36.4 patients were currently on statins while the other 7 63.6 had a history of statin intolerance . since lipid apheresis is an advanced treatment for an uncommon genetic disease the limited number of patients available to participate in the study led to a small sample size . ldl apheresis was performed at abbott northwestern hospital using the kaneka liposorber la15 system kaneka medical products . the event rate reduction was not statistically significant but showed a strong trend toward cardiac event rate reduction before and after apheresis . this study therefore reports the experience in a single metropolitan center of

to date has not been explored particularly as either a or the cognitive tests alone may not have the desired sensitivity or specificity for prediction of future mci ad . although at present no studies have reported sensitivity and specificity of csf a142 in predicting mci ad conversion from normal cognition a large multicenter study has shown that csf a142 predicts transition from mci to ad while

of a142 1.17 2.33 sd and a142a140 ratios 0.75 2.63 sd where individuals in the highest quartile of a142 1.33 1.86 sd and a142a140 ratios improved by nearly one point 0.6 1.82 sd . at the time of blood draw subjects maintained cognitively normal status as determined by their performance on an annual cognitive assessment battery . this current work presented here provides evidence that the combination of brief neuropsychological tests and blood a has potential utility in predicting mci ad at least 2 to 4 years prior to the clinical classification of mci or diagnosis of ad . this proposed method warrants further investigation to determine its practical applicability in specialized clinic setting by allied health personal and in routine primary care clinics . time dependent cox regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between these cognitive tests and a on the prediction of subsequent conversion to mci ad . in this study we examined the usefulness of brief neuropsychological tests in combination with blood a140 and a142 as a predictive test for detecting mci ad in at risk older adults at a pre symptomatic stage . in our study we demonstrate that low a142 and a142a140 ratios are associated with cognitive decline even within one year . hence serum a appears suitable for use in predicting mci ad and optimal sensitivity and specificity is probably achievable if combined with current diagnostic procedures such as brief neuropsychological testing . cox regression analyses show that the model using neuropsychological tests predicted mci ad 2 log likelihood 206.51 52.11 df 8 p .001 . in 2005 the roskamp institute initiated a proteomic ancillary study f. crawford pi involving blood draw from these subjects . for mci ad subjects with the lowest quartile of the a142a140 ratios the 3ms values remained ultimately unchanged 0.16 1.20 sd while the scores improved among those with the highest quartile of the a142a140 ratios 4.33 1.20 sd and these differences were also statistically significant f 3.10 p .046 . our study provides support that blood based a levels may have diagnostic utility when combined with neuropsychological measures . differences among groups on demographic variables neuropsychological variables and serum a140 levels were examined using either the student s t test or analyses depending on the type of variable measurement . for the 3ms scores among subjects who converted to mci ad those with a142 in the lowest quartile declined 1.83 1.28 sd as compared to the highest quartile 4.83 1.35 sd and this difference was statistically significant f 3.42 p .033 . verbal learning and memory associated with mci ad or tests that were similar to those previously shown to be associated with a levels . we have also shown that in subjects diagnosed with ad there is an association between measures of language tests of fluency and object naming and a140 and that memory performance is associated with serum a142 . mri or ct as applicable . the final full model adjusting for confound and the study medications included hvlt r fluency 3ms a142 levels and a142 quartiles 2 log likelihood 166.25 74.55 df 18 p .001 with fluency 3ms and a142 in the lowest two quartiles as significant individual predictors of mci ad in the model . for generative verbal fluency test a decline was noted in both the lowest quartile 4.17 1.40 sd and the highest quartile 1.17 2.13 sd of a142 and these differences were marginally significant f 2.63 p .073 . the highest sensitivity and specificity was achieved using a combination of cognitive scores and a142a140 ratio but this finding was driven by a142 . furthermore sensitivity with specificity of at least 80 for the combined measures was superior to neuropsychological measures or to serum a levels alone . in addition our findings also demonstrate the importance of accounting for factors such as apoe vascular risk factors and medications when using a in predicting mci ad . among individuals who remained cognitively normal while a similar pattern was observed those with lowest quartile of a142 and a142a140 ratios had a larger decline than those with the highest quartile for each hvlt r 0.28 0.27 sd versus . timeframe from baseline cognitive testing to blood draw was 2.25 years 0.71 sd and from blood draw to diagnosis was 1.79 years 1.2 sd . only 23 of the cognitively normal individuals had serum a142 in the lowest quartile compared to the nearly 50 of the diagnostic group 44 of mci subjects and 50 of ad subjects . logistic regression modeling was employed to construct receiver operator curves roc to examine the predictive performance of neuropsychological measures from the baseline visit and serum a levels in diagnoses of mci ad . due to significant intercorrelations between these tests analyses described below are limited to those baseline cognitive tests that were sensitive to early changes i.e.", "", ". . . we show that in contrast to rad6 catenin is expressed in more than 50 of the tumor cells in almost all nevi and melanoma tumors . melanoma progression from primary to metastatic disease was not associated with changes in the i percentage of melanomas expressing rad6 100 of primary and metastatic melanomas or ii percentage of melanomas expressing rad6 in more than 50 of the tumor cells 100 and 96 of primary and metastatic melanomas resp . progression of melanoma from primary to metastatic disease was not significantly associated with further changes in the percentage of tumors expressing rad6 or rad expression intensity as 50 of tumor cells stained positively in 100 and 96 of primary melanomas and metastatic melanomas respectively . approximately 93 of nevi expressed catenin compared to only 27 of nevi that expressed rad6 in more than 50 of their cells figure 2 . interestingly only one of the 30 nevi atypical nevus 3 expressed rad6 in 80 of the cells and none of the primary and metastatic melanomas expressed rad6 in 40 of the cells figure 2 . however our results show that the expression levels of catenin do not contribute to melanoma initiation and progression since no difference in catenin levels was found between nevi primary melanoma and metastatic melanoma 9397 of all samples expressed catenin in 50 of the tumor cells . approximately 93 of nevi expressed catenin in more than 50 of the cells whereas only 27 of the same population of nevi expressed rad6 figure 2 . concurrently with this increase the percentage of tumors that expressed cytoplasmic catenin decreased from nevi 90 to primary and metastatic melanomas 45 and 38 resp . concurrently the percentage of cases that expressed cytoplasmic catenin decreased from 90 in nevi to 45 and 39 in primary and metastatic melanomas respectively figure 4 . however this direct positive correlation between catenin and rad6 expression does not appear to be conserved in melanoma as the expression profiles of catenin and rad6 differed considerably in nevi . while all primary melanomas displayed strong rad6 staining 50 of the tumor cells rad6 was negative in 63 of the nevi . however it is unlikely that the high rad6 expression in primary melanoma is driven by the concurrent high catenin expression because rad6 expression is low in nevi despite the presence of high cytoplasmic catenin expression that is comparable to primary melanoma . none of the nevi or melanomas expressed catenin in the nucleus figure 1 . a tumor was considered to be stained with high intensity if 50 of the cells in a specimen expressed rad6 or catenin similar to the criteria used by mineta et al . also the percentages of nevi 93 primary melanoma 97 and metastatic melanoma 93 that expressed catenin in more than 50 of the cells did not differ significantly figures 1 2 and 3 . in this study we examined rad6 and catenin expressions in serial sections of nevi primary and metastatic melanomas to determine their potential roles in melanoma development and metastatic progression . the percentage of cases that expressed catenin on the cell membrane increased dramatically from 10 in nevi to 83 and 93 in primary and metastatic melanomas respectively .", "also for the 5dsi and 8dsi ammonia adducts nearly equal yields for the diastereomers were observed . in contrast to these results riboflavin oxidations in the presence of nh4cl gave more c5 adducts 29 than c8 adducts 11 and na2ircl6 oxidations did not yield detectable amounts of c8 adducts . relative product distributions observed when dg reacted with nucleophilic h2o or nh3 in oxidation reactions . thus oxidation of lysine to an aminyl radical that adds to c8 of dg is possible with na2ircl6 0.9 v vs nhe ph 7 and riboflavin 1.7 v vs nhe ph 7 in contrast the analogous reaction does not readily occur for nh3 because at ph 7 dg is the dominant site of oxidation due to its lower redox potential leading to products other than 8dsi . furthermore the increase in 8dsi yield from the dsodn oxidations further supports this product resulting from nucleophilic addition of nh3 at c8 leading to 8dsi and not the nh3 aminyl radical adding at c8 to yield the same product . furthermore if deamination of either 5dsi or 8dsi to dsp occurs in the nmr tube during analysis the peaks observed would be similar and challenging to interpret therefore the best method for obtaining structural data on the diastereomers of 5dsi and 8dsi is via the esi ms ms that was conducted figure 2 and provided satisfactory results to determine their structures . the adducts derived from the nucleophile trapping of electrophilic dg oxidation intermediates show nh3 participation through the products 5dsi 29 that was the highest yielding nh3 adduct followed by nearly 3fold less 8dsi 11 . esi ms figure s1 supporting information and the adducts observed that did not involve participation of nh3 during product formation included dz m 21 dog m 16 dgh m 6 and dsp m 32 scheme 2 . a similar experiment was conducted for the 8dsi diastereomers . these results clearly demonstrate a dependence on the reaction context in formation of dg oxidation products and nh3 adducts . the major product for riboflavin was dz rose bengal yielded the 5dsi diastereomers and na2ircl6 gave the dsp diastereomers as the major products figure 3 . further one electron oxidized dog was observed to have an even lower redox potential than the parent compound dog which means that once oxidation of dog and likely 8amino dg occurs product formation is inevitable due to the 70 conversion to product that yielded the spirocyclic compounds dsp 5dsi or 8dsi . oxidations of dg in the nucleoside ss and dsodn contexts with photochemically activated riboflavin demonstrated three major context effects 1 the yield of dz was highest in the nucleoside studies and decreased dramatically in dsodn contexts 2 when nh3 participated as the nucleophile 5dsi was obtained in the highest yield in nucleoside studies while the yield of 8dsi was highest in dsodn contexts and 3 when h2o was the nucleophile in nucleoside reactions dsp presented in the highest yield while in dsodn contexts dgh was obtained in the highest yield figure 4 . in this oxidation reaction the distribution did not yield nh3 adducts as the major products which was unexpected on the basis of nh3 being the better nucleophile compared to h2o . the nh3 adducts 5dsi and 8dsi provided some interesting context dependent product distributions . the riboflavin oxidations were conducted similarly to those reported for the nucleoside studies with the following exceptions the ssodn oxidations were conducted on 20 m samples while the dsodn oxidations were conducted on 10 m samples . in summary one electron oxidant driven oxidations of dg in the presence of nh3 lead to spirocyclic adducts at c5 and c8 that are in competition with h2o adducts of the same core structure . this list of products represents those that are consistently observed from many oxidant systems conducted by several laboratories however other compounds have been reported in lower yield . comparison of the product distributions observed with the one electron oxidants riboflavin and na2ircl6 identified both nh3 and h2o adducted compounds . the products observed when phenols participate with dg during oxidation have more variability in their structures compared to amine adducts . the former work from our laboratory proposed that c8 amine adducts result from oxidation of the amine to the aminyl radical that adds at the c8 carbon of dg followed by oxidation leading to product formation scheme 4 . as a last comparison the 8dsi diastereomer ecd spectra were compared to those recorded for dsp note 8dsi and dsp isomers with the same geometric configuration of the spirocyclic ring give opposite r and s assignments due to a difference in the cahn the low energy lobe gave a negative rotation at 262 nm similar to rdsp and r8dsi gave a positive rotation similar to sdsp . the adducts characterized by our laboratory and others show lysine competing with water for sites of covalent bond formation where a single lysine is observed at c8 analogous to dog at either c5 or c8 of a spirocyclic core similar to dsp and last a bis adduct at c5 and c8 with a spirocyclic ring structure has been identified figure 1 . in the current work oxidations that allowed dg to react with nh3 were conducted while the full product and diastereomer distributions were monitored . the present studies mapped the pathways and quantified the products observed when dg was allowed to react with nh4cl in the presence of the photooxidants riboflavin and rose bengal as well as the one electron oxidant na2ircl6 . a similar observation has been highlighted for oxidations occurring in tris buffer that generate tris adducts to dg . adducts observed when dg and lysine are allowed to react in the presence of oxidant . support for exclusive nucleophilic attack at c5 under o2 oxidations was derived from h2o studies followed by mapping the labeled site by esi ms ms the current observation that the only nh3 adducts were the 5dsi diastereomers further support this previously proposed mechanism and further confirms our structural assignments for these peaks . as previously stated the lifetime of the electrophilic dg is longer in the duplex context and the superior nucleophilicity of nh3 compared to h2o greatly increased the yield of 8dsi in dsodn oxidations scheme 6 . h2o and nh3 at c8 ultimately yielding a spirocyclic product after completion of the four electron oxidation . in contrast the r and s assignments for the 8dsi diastereomers are opposite those of dsp thus s8dsi elutes first and r8dsi elutes second and from the hypercarb hplc column figure 4 . after careful characterization of the nucleoside reactions similar oxidations were conducted in the single stranded and duplex oligodeoxynucleotide odn contexts . the void volume was collected dried and reinjected on a hypercarb hplc column to analyze the diastereomers of dgh dsp 5dsi and 8dsi as well as the product dz while monitoring their absorbance at 240 nm . in nucleoside dg this proposed mechanism best supports the observation of ammonia adducts at c8 because upon one electron oxidation of dg the initial radical cation dg formed is very acidic pka 3.9 and rapidly deprotonates to the neutral radical dg that is not susceptible to nucleophilic attack . in contrast the yield of 8dsi was smallest for the nucleoside 11 and increased by more than 3fold in the ssodn context 39 and over half the products observed in the dsodn context were 8dsi 54 . the second oxidant studied was rose bengal a type ii photooxidant o2 that furnished 5dsi as the major product 62 followed by a 3fold lower amount of dsp 31 and low yields of dz 5 and dgh 2 were observed to complete the mass balance figure 3 . a comparison between the contexts studied when dg was allowed to react with nh3 in the presence of the photooxidant riboflavin is provided in figure 5 . for example when dg is oxidized in the presence of lysine products retaining the dg heterocycle and those with a core similar to dgh or dsp have been observed . in the riboflavin mediated oxidations this result was anticipated because riboflavin is a type i photooxidant and effects oxidation by electron transfer from dg yielding o2 under aerobic reaction conditions . we propose the difference in the current ammonia results compared to the lysine data can be attributed to a difference in the mechanism of product formation for the c8 adduct in the nucleoside context . first both 5 and 8dsi were stable at ph 10 during this time frame while 5dsi readily hydrolyzed to dsp at ph 3 in 30 min and 8dsi hydrolyzed to dsp after 10 h. for 5dsi deamination of the amine group can occur by two possible mechanisms 1 a retro acyl migration can occur followed by loss of nh3 to yield an electrophilic intermediate dog susceptible to h2o attack followed by a second acyl migration back to dsp or 2 acid catalyzed deamination can occur directly to furnish dsp scheme 5 . this observation has already been reported in the literature and is proposed to result from the odn context increasing the lifetime of the dg that reacts with nucleophilic h2o to give the c8 product dog while decreasing the lifetime of dg that reacts with o2 to yield dz schemes 2 and 6 . in the nucleoside studies 1 mm dg was studied and in the odn contexts 20 m ssodn or 10 m dsodn was studied . the hydantoins are also readily formed from direct four electron oxidation with o2 . with respect to the yields of the hydantoins more dsp relative to dgh was observed in the nucleoside context 11 vs 4 respectively versus the dsodn context 9 vs 21 respectively . the purified ammonia adducts were also studied with respect to their decomposition pathways leading to end products that have not been previously determined . for the last set of studies we were inspired by the observation that the a ring of dsp mimics the h bonding pattern of thymidine while the a ring of 5dsi mimics the h bonding pattern of 2deoxycytidine figure 6 . the first rp hplc run allowed analysis of dog and 8amino dg both observed in 1 yield while all other products eluted in the void volume of this run . in the riboflavin oxidation dz was the major product while in the rose bengal oxidation 5dsi was the major product and these observations can be ascribed to each oxidant s unique mechanism of oxidation schemes 2 and 3 . the reaction without nh4cl gave the dsp diastereomers and the reaction with nh4cl gave the 5dsi diastereomers . the photooxidant riboflavin was chosen for the studies because it gave the most diverse distribution of products in the nucleoside reactions and might provide the most insight into context effects . the unencumbered nucleoside dg 1 mm was chosen for the initial oxidation reactions where nh4cl 20 mm provided the source of nucleophilic nh3 . in the dg oxidation studies a spermine adduct at c8 is observed retaining the dg heterocyclic core while dog oxidations yield an adduct at c5 that does not undergo acyl migration to create a spirocycle but instead the polyamine can generate an unstable hemiaminal intermediate that decomposes leaving a ribosylurea lesion at the adduct formation site . as stated above the diastereomerically pure ammonia adduct samples were determined to decompose to give a single diastereomer of dsp therefore on the basis of hplc elution order the absolute configuration for the diastereomers of the two dsi constitutional isomers can be determined . reactions were conducted with 1 mm dg 20 mm nh4cl in 75 mm napi buffer ph 7.4 at 22 c . oxidations were conducted with 2deoxyguanosine dg at 1 mm concentration in 75 mm napi buffer ph 7.4 and 22 c . hplc was used to provide diastereomerically pure 5dsi and 8dsi samples that were subjected to conditions of ph 3 0.1 formic acid or ph 10 20 mm napi at 22 c for 30 min or 10 h. not only could the decomposition products be determined but having diastereomerically pure starting material also allowed us to probe the mechanism of decomposition specifically for 5dsi . the first observation from these data was with respect to dz distributions that dramatically decreased when proceeding from the nucleoside to odn contexts specifically the dz distribution in the dsodn context 2 was 10fold less than the ssodn context 20 and 20fold less than that observed in the nucleoside context 40 . the first eluting 5dsi and 8dsi diastereomers decomposed to the first dsp diastereomer r and the late eluting diastereomer decomposed to the late eluting dsp diastereomer s therefore for 5dsi the r diastereomer elutes first and the s diastereomer elutes second because the r and s assignments are the same between dsp and 5dsi . previously in riboflavin oxidations spirodihydantoins with lysine at c8 were 2fold greater than those with lysine at c5 figure 1 and in na2ircl6 oxidations a c8 lysine adduct was observed . relative product distributions measured when dg was allowed to react with nh3 in the presence of photoexcited riboflavin in various contexts . keeping this limitation in mind the oxidation of dg by riboflavin initially yields dg that rapidly deprotonates to dg in the nucleoside contexts pka 3.9 dominating the product forming step of the reaction . the yield for the thermodynamically preferred product spiroiminodihydantoin dsp m 32 is greatest in nucleoside reactions at ph 6 or in unencumbered reaction contexts i.e. upon incubation of one diastereomer of 5dsi at ph 3 only one diastereomer of dsp was observed supporting the direct deamination mechanism . single stranded dna or g quadruplexes while the yield of 5guanidinohydantoin dgh m 6 is greatest in nucleoside reactions at ph 6 or in sterically demanding duplex contexts scheme 1 . comparison of the esi ms ms spectrum for 5dsi with dsp gave a pair of peaks for 5dsi that established c5 as the site of nh3 attachment m z m h 140 and 96 figure 2 . next dog is trapped by nucleophiles at c5 leading to dsp with h2o or 5dsi with nh3 scheme 3 . the absolute stereochemistry for the diastereomers of the ammonia adducts had not yet been determined . esi ms ms spectra for dsp top 5dsi middle and 8dsi bottom . with respect to insertion opposite the dsp diastereomers rdsp was observed to give a slight preference for insertion of datp opposite and sdsp gave nearly equal insertion of datp and dgtp .", "two months after

table 4 as dependent variable was related to the amount of pesticide used in liters frequency of use and duration of use . this study aimed to identify the pesticide exposure and risk factors among vegetable farmers . this study has shown the pesticide exposure of farmers in the largest vegetable producing area in the philippines . target population consisted of vegetable farmers in the largest

cropping seasons with a mean of 3.84 mean 2.3 0.53 months per cropping season table 1 . data gathering was done using the following 1 questionnaire structured personal interview with farm workers farmers was done by research assistants who were trained prior to the data collection . many circumstances contributed to nonadherence to proper use of ppe like extreme heat during pesticide application uncomfortable to use few resources to afford new ppe peer related factors and increasing age 18 2527 . sumicidine which was the most commonly used pesticides among the benguet farmers contains fenvalerate . in 2005 and thompson et al . on the other hand other active ingredients like cypermethrin mancozeb and skin sensations were reported to occur among field workers and usually lasted only for a few hours and did not persist for more than one day after exposure to cypermethrin . the health data were also collected by medical doctors who simultaneously conducted physical assessment of the farmers . most often gloves were the most commonly used personal protective equipment because the hands were the most exposed areas 23 24 . the same trend was seen among farmers in sri lanka and in brazil 15 16 . all the independent variables except amount and years of pesticide use were categorical variables . however growing vegetables is considered a risk occupation in some areas in developing countries . it is a discouraging fact though that with knowledge of health risks many filipino families still perceive that crop yield outweighs the health risks associated with pesticide use . majority 87 the most common route of pesticide entry in the study was respiratory 68.9 followed by dermal and ocular entry 60.5 and 38 resp . in 1999 is an important determinant of

extremely important to understand which is the predominant precursor population in the different stages of life and which population should be used in a paediatric patient instead of an adult one . used heterozygous isl1lacz mice a more sensitive genetic approach to investigate the presence and localisation of these precursor cells in 30 animals at different time points after birth 10 weeks to 18 months . anversa s research group described rat cardiac stem cells for the first time many research groups have claimed to have discovered new and important cardiac progenitor stem cells in the adult heart .. since 2005 the scientific community talked about adult c kit andor sca1 andor mdr1 cells and embryonic isl1 cells . other evidence supports the hypothesis that isl1 cells are not a different population from sca1 cpcs . di nardo s research group described the concomitant expression of the isl1 c kit and sca1 markers in adult mouse cardiac progenitor cells in 2008 while in 2009 our research group confirmed the expression of the three markers in adult rat cpcs . this paper demonstrated by confocal analysis that all isl1 cells were also c kit while c kit cells were not necessarily isl1 as if isl1 cells were a subpopulation of c kit cells . these two populations have always been considered different entities and are described separately in many research papers and reviews although expression of the isl1 transcription factor by cardiac precursor cells has also been reported in adult hearts . c kit sca1 and isl1 in the same cardiac precursor cell . other research groups later described the co expression of isl1 sca1 andor c kit and we further demonstrated that in samples from foetal and postnatal human hearts there was also an isl1 subpopulation of c kit cells . in a systematic work published in 2011 about the identification of isl1 cells in the mouse heart from postnatal day 1 to young adulthood in different strains the authors found clusters of positive cells in the cardiac ganglia of the studied strains while found very a few clusters of isl1 cardiac precursors only in 129svj or balb c strains and in animals not older than 4 months . it has been demonstrated very recently that isl1 labels both shf precursors and some cardiac neural crest cells and that mef2c is a more efficient marker of the shf progenitor cells in labelling experiments . considering that other authors identified isl1 cells in adult murine and rat hearts weinberger et al . in the review and in the research paper published in 2009 we reported the concomitant expression of isl1 c kit and sca1 in a population of cpcs isolated without any sorting or selection and suggested for the first time that there could be a unique population of cells with several subpopulations and that the several markers identified could be only the effect of different cultivation conditions in the different laboratories . moreover considering heart development in different species such as chicken mouse and xenopus it appears that isl1 is expressed in a common cardiac cell population that splits into fhf and shf lineages during heart development and that this common progenitor also contributes cells to the cardiovascular system . our research group identified isl1 cells during gestation until the postnatal age and demonstrated the contemporary expression of isl1 and c kit in the interstitial cells in the ventricular myocardium in human foetal and postnatal hearts . the contemporary expression of sca1 and isl1 has been described both in a subpopulation of sca1c kit cells identified and isolated from adult mouse hearts and in sca1 cardiosphere derived cells obtained from cardiac explants from normal sham operated or post myocardial infarct hearts . they found four different populations of isl1 cells i clusters of isl1 neurons were found in the cardiac parasympathetic ganglia of the posterior side of the heart and in the nervous plexus surrounding the pulmonary veins ii clusters of isl1 smooth muscle cells were found in the muscular layer above the aortic and pulmonary valve in the proximal part of the aorta and the trunk of the pulmonary artery only a few positive cells were present in the aortic valve leaflets iii clusters of isl1 cardiomyocytes were found in the left ventricular outflow tract region iv clusters of isl1 sinoatrial node san cells were found in the muscular wall between right atrium and vena cava superior .", "t1weighted images t1wi revealed spinal and cranial gd enhancing nodules in the leptomeninges figures 1a e and on t2weighted

explain why they may go unreported . however a later neurosurgical evaluation showed conus medullaris syndrome and a second magnetic resonance imaging study showed the conus infarct . considering this observation we believe that it is unlikely that our patient had this low lying artery that could have then been injected with an epidural steroid at this precise location .", "", "for example small fragments of a corresponding to the amino acid sequences to which act a1 12 and apoe a12 28 bind can serve as decoy peptides that prevent the binding of apoe to a and its catalysis of a into neurotoxic species . in sum it appears that the preponderance of the data can be most consistently interpreted as showing that the brain inflammatory protein apoe plays a catalytic role in the ad ds amyloid cascade and consequent cognitive decline with binding and clearance differences between the apoe isoforms reflecting their differing abilities to bind to a and catalyze its conversion into neurotoxic macromolecular species figure 2 . this result may reflect the ability of mouse act to promote amyloid formation but that in the presence of the stronger binding apoe and apoj proteins mouse act is prevented from exhibiting its catalytic activity . if apoe is an amyloid catalyst then reducing apoe levels or function in the brain should result in reduced amyloid deposition and reduced cognitive decline . all experiments carried out so far in vitro or in transgenic mice indicate that the ability of a to form neurotoxic filaments or oligomers and cause cognitive decline are increased in the presence of apoe particularly mouse apoe and human apoe4 with apoe2 being protective . indeed we found that two a antibodies 6e10 which is directed to the same the n terminal sequence bound by act and 13 m which binds to the c terminus function very differently in the in vitro a polymerization assay . similarly amyloid plaques in app mice contain mouse act and injecting a1 11 into one side of the app mouse brain to block act s binding site with endogenous a rapidly reduced amyloid load compared to the other vehicle injected side of the brain . because of apoe s essential genetic and therefore presumably biochemical contribution to ad pathology and cognitive decline it is critical that its role in the ad pathogenic pathway amyloid cascade be elucidated in order for therapeutics based on apoe to be designed . the ability of different apoe isoforms to bind a with different strengths can also explain why human apoe isoforms slow amyloid deposition in the presence of the endogenous mouse apoe for they may bind a more tightly or differently than mouse apoe and slow the catalytic conversion of a into oligomers polymers in the mouse background . furthermore the inflammatory cytokine il1 that is overexpressed in ad brain induces astrocyte expression of act and blocking il1 expression in app transgenic mice by ibuprofen treatment thereby reducing mouse act expression lowers amyloid formation and restores cognition . it was proposed that human apoe might serve to inhibit a clearance from the brain compared to mouse apoe with apoe4 inhibiting clearance the most . this conclusion and the in vivo demonstration that blocking apoe a interaction prevents ad in a mouse model suggests that this decoy approach should be translatable into human patients and serve as an effective new approach to ad therapy . if on the other hand apoe is involved in a clearance with human apoe4 being a greater inhibitor of clearance or poorer clearer then reducing apoe levels or apoe binding to a should increase amyloid deposition and cognitive decline . even though the key predictions of the polymerization hypothesis that is apoe serving as an a filament catalyst have been borne out the compelling experiments demonstrating that human apoe inhibits filament formation in a mouse background require explanation . the data showing that human apoe inhibits a clearance can also be interpreted as reflecting apoe s role in catalyzing a oligo polymerization .", "the main radiographic features of osteoporosis are increased radiolucency and cortical thinning

used for the immunoaffinity purification of 6oxo m1dg from urine and feces followed by lc ms ms quantification against the stable isotope labeled internal standard n56oxo m1dg . the purified sample is subjected to lc ms ms analysis where 6oxo m1dg is quantified via stable isotope dilution against the synthetic internal standard n56oxo m1dg which is introduced to the sample prior to antibody purification . although many studies have shown that the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde can react in vitro with deoxyguanosine to form m1dg recent studies in e. coli with defined polyunsaturated fatty acid content in membrane phospholipids indicate that this is not a major source of m1dg . the limit of detection lod of the described lc ms ms system was established at approximately 10 fmol 6oxo m1dg on column supporting information figure f top by analyzing a series of increasingly dilute 6oxo m1dg solutions . the purification and analysis protocol outlined in materials and methods was used to quantify aliquots of 10 mm potassium phosphate ph 8.0 spiked with varying amounts of 6oxo m1dg 0.25 2.5 and 25 pmol and 1.0 pmol of the internal standard n56oxo m1dg n 3 for each concentration of 6oxo m1dg . a representative lc ms ms chromatogram of 6oxo m1dg and the internal standard n56oxo m1dg isolated from rat feces is displayed . these data demonstrate that 100 l of the antibody gel is able to bind at least 26 pmol of 6oxo m1dg from solution and lc ms ms detection of the purified sample is quantitative . a m z 320 peak was not observed for n56oxo m1dg indicating that no unlabeled 6oxo m1dg was present in the internal standard . there is no peak in the 6oxo m1dg trace of the inset which is illustrative of the fact that there was no isotopic impurity in the internal standard that could contribute to the 6oxo m1dg signal . 6oxo m1dg m1dg and structural analogues that were used as competitive antigens during elisa analysis of murine sera hybridomal supernatant and purified antibodies . a major contributor to the low levels of m1dg is its oxidative metabolism to 6oxo m1dg . 6oxo m1dg antibodies are present in the serum of mouse balb cj r. the serum of mouse balb cj r was subjected to competitive elisa analysis with 6oxo m1dg used as the competitor . 6oxo m1dg and its internal standard n56oxo m1dg were detected via selected reaction monitoring srm with the following transitions respectively m z 320 204 and 325 209 . only 6oxo m1dg attenuated the optical density indicating a specificity of the purified mab for 6oxo m1dg over close structural analogues . additionally the lc ms ms system provided a linear response to 6oxo m1dg solutions over a 5000fold concentration range and a single n56oxo m1dg concentration supporting information f bottom . figure 5 shows the elisa responses of the mab purified from 6c9ba4c12 in the presence of 6oxo m1dg and structural analogues . base propenal formation is triggered by abstraction of the hydrogen from the c4 position of the deoxyribosyl unit of double stranded dna . 6oxo m1dg and its stable isotope labeled analogue n56oxo m1dg were synthesized as previously described . the antibody gel shows excellent recovery of 6oxo m1dg from buffer solutions . figure 3 depicts a competitive elisa analysis of the 35week serum from mouse balb cj r. this analysis employed 6oxo m1dg as the competing antigen and a robust concentration dependent decrease in optical density is observed indicating the presence of anti6oxo m1dg antibodies in the sera from this mouse . because 6oxo m1dg is present endogenously in rats it suggests that its metabolic precursor m1dg is also produced endogenously in rats and metabolized to 6oxo m1dg . 6oxo m1dg was quantitated by stable isotope dilution against n56oxo m1dg . purified antibodies from the hybridomal subclone 6c9ba4c12 were screened for specificity for 6oxo m1dg in the presence of structural analogues using competitive elisa analyses . figure 4 shows a representative elisa analysis of the supernatants from two subclones b and e2 of parental hybridoma cell line 6c9 in which xanthine and 6oxo m1dg are employed as competing antigens . the inset of figure 6 is the internal standard alone after recovery from pbs . this suggests 6oxo m1dg may be superior to m1dg as a noninvasive marker of oxidative damage . because 6oxo m1dg is the sole metabolite of m1dg in rats it appears to be an ideal surrogate for m1dg as an in vivo biomarker for oxidative stress . this idea is consistent with the finding that m1dg is present in rodent and human genomic dna and with studies from this laboratory demonstrating that 6oxo m1dg is the sole metabolite of m1dg . these results indicate that the gel provided a sufficient level of recovery of the analyte and its internal standard as well as sufficient capacity for the expected levels of 6oxo m1dg present in rat urine and feces . aliquots of murine serum dilutions hybridoma supernatants or purified antibody depending on the stage of the antibody development process were then incubated in the coated wells with or without the addition of varying concentrations of 6oxo m1dg and structural analogues figure 1 in a final volume of 100 l pbs for 60 min at 37 c . mass spectrometric analysis of 6oxo m1dg showed an m h peak at m z 320 while analysis of n56oxo m1dg showed an m h peak at m z 325 . in the assay the sepharose bound mab is used to isolate 6oxo m1dg from urine and feces . the following solutions were prepared as follows and their use is described below a carbonate bicarbonate coating buffer ph 9.6 was prepared from na2co3 1.59 g l and thimerosal 0.10 g l b pbs tween ph 7.4 was prepared from nacl 8.00 g l tween 20 1.00 ml l and thimerosal 0.10 g l c bsa 5.0 g mixed in pbs

microtiter plates or 384well 4hb flat bottom plates were coated with 50 75 or 100 l of a 10 g ml solution of 6oxo m1guo bsa antigen in carbonate bicarbonate coating buffer a and incubated at 4 c overnight . eight mice were inoculated with adduct protein conjugate followed by tail bleeding and testing for the presence of 6oxo m1dg antibodies using direct elisa analysis step 1 . this is consistent with previous findings that demonstrate m1dg is excreted mainly in urine whereas 6oxo m1dg is excreted mainly in feces . thus the gel was able to bind 6oxo m1dg from an aqueous solution and released the analyte in the presence of methanol . aliquots of diluted horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat antimouse igg fc region specific or igg h l secondary antibody diluted 15000 in pbs tween bsa were added and the plates were incubated at 37 c for 60 min . positive hybridoma supernatants were rescreened in the presence of xanthine and 6oxo m1dg . the presence of unbound 6oxo m1dg decreases the optical density of both b and e2 supernatants indicating the presence of anti6oxo m1dg antibodies . the gel was used to recover 6oxo m1dg and n5 6oxo m1dg from various fluids by the following general procedure . for wells that included 6oxo m1dg or structural analogues the serum dilution used was 15000 in pbs tween b and the compounds depicted in figure 1 were preincubated in the dilute murine serum for 45 min prior to the serum addition step . the ability to measure excreted 6oxo m1dg has the potential for clinical relevance in assessing the levels of oxidative dna damage in humans . for subclone e2 xanthine has a similar effect demonstrating that e2 s mab are not specific to 6oxo m1dg . supporting information figure e illustrates that cell line 6c9ba4 a subclone of hybridoma 6c9b retained activity against 6oxo m1dg but did not react to xanthine .", "1 . mg sulfate is effective in the treatment of migraine attacks and collins and colleagues reported that 70 mg kg

antegastric bypasses with no mesenteric closure and no division of the mesentery . permanent sutures were used to close these defects but 15 of 18 patients in the series presented with open defects causing ih . the reported incidence of sbo after lgb varies widely perhaps because the technique used in the operation also varies widely not only in placement of the roux limb but regarding closure or nonclosure of the mesenteric defects . most authors seem to agree that if a retrocolic gastric bypass is performed the mesocolic defect must be closed which can lead to a 0 rate of ih formation although that number can climb as high as 15 . multiple defects in the mesentery of the bowel can occur and may lead to ih and in an antecolic bypass a defect is associated with the roux limb passing

study was to investigate the vascular protective effect of krg in acrolein stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells huvecs . p38 mapk creb and intracellular ros generation are involved in this inhibition of cox2 expression in acrolein stimulated huvecs by krg . immunofluorescence analysis showed that acrolein induced cox2 protein levels were inhibited in huvecs after treatment with krg fig . we found that krg inhibited both mrna and the protein level of cox2 and its cytoprotective effect in acrolein stimulated huvecs . a previous study showed that the induction of ho1 expression may exert protective effects in krg treated human endothelial cells . the results indicate that ros generation in cells treated with acrolein increased compared to untreated cells whereas krg inhibited acrolein induced ros generation fig . however there have been no reports revealing the mechanism underlying krg inhibited cox2 expression in acrolein unsaturated aldehydes in cs stimulated huvecs . in a previous study it was shown that inhibition of oxidative stress exerts protection in human endothelial cells which could be an effective strategy in the treatment of vascular diseases . in this study we explored the inhibition of an inflammatory mediator cox2 by krg water extract in huvecs . in addition our previous study suggested that krg exerts a cytoprotective effect through the induction of heme oxygenase ho1 expression suggesting a possible therapeutic mechanism of krg in cardiovascular diseases . after pretreatment of acrolein stimulated cells with krg the cells were fixed and cox2 localization in huvecs was observed by immunofluorescence staining with an anti cox2 antibody followed by a fluorescence tagged secondary antibody . cox2 plays an important role in inflammation therefore inhibition of cox2 expression may participate in the treatment of inflammation related diseases such as vascular diseases . vascular diseases may in part be caused by cox2 upregulation at sites of inflammation and vascular injury . these results revealed that the vascular protective effect of krg is mediated by the inhibition of cox2 expression in acrolein stimulated huvecs . chronic inflammation plays an important role in vascular diseases therefore cox2 may participate in the development of inflammation related diseases including vascular diseases . numerous studies have reported the involvement of cs in vascular diseases through cox2 and endothelial no synthase activity . accumulating evidence suggests that krg is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses suggesting an anti inflammatory effect of krg . a previous study found that acrolein in cs induces cox2 expression in human endothelial cells . it is well known that chronic inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of many human diseases such as atherosclerosis . huvecs were maintained in m199 medium and supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum 1 penicillin and streptomycin 10 ng ml human fibroblast growth factor and 18 mu ml heparin . m199 medium and fetal bovine serum krg powder was soaked in water 125 w w for 3 h and boiled for 40 min . cells were washed in pbs resuspended in 100 l binding buffer containing 5 l annexin v fitc and 1 g ml pi and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the dark . as mentioned above therefore the inhibition of cox2 expression following krg water extract treatment may be associated with its strong protective effect in acrolein stimulated huvecs . these results indicate that krg may play a role in the inhibition of cox2 expression via reduction of acrolein generated ros in acrolein stimulated huvecs . in conclusion we propose that the krg water extract may exert a cytoprotective effect through the inhibition of cox2 induction and that this reduction of cox2 in acrolein stimulated huvecs is mediated by the p38 mapk the shift to the right of the curve due to increased fluorescence indicates an increase in the intracellular levels of ros . we calculated the results using the standard curve which were expressed as picograms per milliliter .", "2 . 2014 zhou et al . thus while several web based grna design programs are available for plants such as crispr plant xie et al . 2014 jacobs et al . and crispr p lei et al . no off target cleavage in the 4cl5 locus was detected in 4cl1edited lines suggesting that crispr cas9 editing in populus is highly specific zhou et al . 2014 zhang et al . negative experiment where mismatches between a 4cl5grna designed based on the p. trichocarpa reference genome phytozome v3 and the corresponding sequence of p. tremula x alba 717 used for transformation abolished cleavage in all transgenic lines examined zhou et al . after our initial publication successful crispr cas9 editing was reported for populus tomentosa fan et al . 2015 zhang et al . 2014 fan et al . using a similar approach with both resequencing and rna seq data we uncovered over 10 m snps from a single individual p. tremula x alba clone 717 that is commonly used in populus transformation xue et al . tool is particularly useful for screening custom grnas or pcr primers against known snps indels in the p. trichocarpa or the custom 717 genome xue et al . 2015 or multiplexing individual grna cassettes brooks et al . 2014 2015 interestingly the most efficient and consistent crispr cas9 editing was reported in hybrid populus tremula x alba clone 717 1b4 717 with biallelic mutations detected in all independent transgenic lines examined zhou et al . however the crispr cas9 knockout of 4cl1 reduced lignin content only by 23 zhou et al . this process can be greatly simplified with crispr cas9 mutants as dna level analysis by amplicon sequencing can identify events with biallelic mutations for further analysis . this process can be greatly simplified with crispr cas9 mutants as dna level analysis by amplicon sequencing can identify events with biallelic mutations for

at the dna level and vectors with a pol iii promoter e.g. transcriptional activation or chromatin modification sander and joung 2014 resequencing of the transformation clone for unbiased variant calling as discussed above for populus 717 xue et al . grnas were designed based on the haploid genome of 1 p. trichocarpa or 2 717 and then cross checked for snps or indels in the 717 target sequences . for instance rnai silencing of 4coumaroyl coa 3hydroxylase in transgenic populus resulted in lignin reductions among 9 independent events that ranged from no change to 1560 coleman et al . c for species with a robust transformation system multiple biallelic crispr cas9 events can be used directly as biological replicates for in depth characterization . c for species with a robust transformation system multiple biallelic crispr cas9 events can be used directly as biological replicates for in depth characterization . down regulation of 4cl1 or its orthologs leads to reduced lignin content and altered lignin structure in a number of species boerjan et al . 2014 unlike with the standard design where grna is transcribed directly from the pol iii u6 or u3 promoter using a specific transcription initiation sequence e.g. to facilitate crispr cas9 genome editing in 717 we constructed a custom 717 genome by substituting 10 m sequence variants into the p. trichocarpa reference genome xue et al . these differences plus unknown allelic heterozygosity likely contributed to the variation in the reported editing efficiencies of different grnas fan et al . recently virus based systems have been explored for transient expression of genome engineering reagents ali et al . in case of difficult to transform species for which few biallelic events may be obtained micropropagation is necessary to obtain biological replicates before in depth characterization as is typically done using gene silencing . in case of difficult to transform species for which few biallelic events may be obtained micropropagation is necessary to obtain biological replicates before in depth characterization as is typically done using gene silencing . wood discoloration patterns

gene is used to select an appropriate promoter for construct preparation . because mature grnas are released following cleavage of the polycistronic transcript by the trna processing machinery there is no sequence constraint at the 5 end of grnas xie et al . even when only a few mutation events are obtained for difficult to transform species or from suboptimal transformation trials the ability to bypass rna level screening and to obtain stable mutations still confers advantages over the gene silencing approaches . as with the 4cl1 case biallelic mutations were observed in all independent transgenic lines surveyed by amplicon sequencing zhou et al . from the first analysis we found that more than 57 of the grnas designed based on the p. trichocarpa genome correspond to regions that harbor snps or indels in 717 xue et al . as depicted in figure 2 primary transformants with confirmed editing can be used directly for in depth characterization when multiple independent events are available as biological replicates zhou et al . b following regeneration of putative transgenic plants conventional screening involves pcr confirmation of transgenes followed by expression analysis to select events with desired or maximum levels of gene suppression . b following regeneration of putative transgenic plants conventional screening involves pcr confirmation of transgenes followed by expression analysis to select events with desired or maximum levels of gene suppression . rnai mediated gene suppression is considered a more effective alternative with improved trait stability li et al . however few studies have addressed the added complexity of sequence polymorphisms on crispr cas9 genome editing probably because the common plant models such as arabidopsis rice soybean and tomato are selfing species with homozygous genomes . gn19ngg or an19ngg respectively wang et al . we assessed crispr cas9 specificity in populus by analyzing its on target versus off target activities among duplicated genes . u6 or u3 for grna expression and a cas9 under control of a constitutive e.g. u6 or u3 for grna expression and a cas9 under control of a constitutive e.g. in the populus study that targeted pds 4 grnas were designed based on one gene model potri.014g148700 without considering the genome duplicate potri.002g235200 that shares a high degree 93 of coding sequence identity . given the high levels of heterozygosity in tree species the need to consider sequence polymorphisms in genome editing experiments can not be over emphasized . we generated 36 independent transgenic lines and amplicon sequencing of randomly selected events confirmed biallelic mutations in all cases zhou et al . as frequently reported for crispr cas9 genome editing small indels especially 1bp modifications were the predominant patterns and predicted to disrupt the reading frame . by designing consensus primers flanking the target site we were able to sequence both 4cl1 and 4cl5 amplicons simultaneously to assess the specificity of crispr cas9 . p. trichocarpa nisqually1 is different from that routinely used for genetic transformation e.g. for outcrossing species lacking a genomic variant database several approaches can be applied to identify snps indels in the genes of interest prior to grna selection . the lower mutation rates compared to our study may be attributed to gene redundancy and sequence heterozygosity that were not accounted for during grna design see discussion below . woody perennials suffer as experimental systems due to the lengthiness of genetic transformation and plant characterization . the metabolic consequence was examined in roots where flavonoid derived condensed tannins cts are known to accumulate to high levels 20 dry weight in the experimental poplar genotype chen et al . this greatly simplifies grna design as any sequences upstream of pam ngg can be used e.g.", "f h . from the selected element maps figure 4c e it is clear that with the exception of the two particles in the lower right hand corner the particles are comprised of a platinum rich core surrounded by an iron oxide shell . we now move on to the analysis of a second cluster of particles comprised of a bimetallic iron platinum core surrounded by an iron oxide shell . also visible were pure iron oxide particles in the lower right hand corner of figure 4a . the edx elemental maps for cobalt iron and oxygen figure 1b d obtained by integration of the element s background subtracted k line x ray peak show that individual particles are comprised of a cobalt core surrounded by a shell composed of iron and oxygen as expected . by conventional elemental mapping one can not tell whether the particles contain a pure platinum core surrounded by an iron oxide shell or whether iron is alloyed with platinum to form a bimetallic core . comparison between raw edx spectra extracted from a fept bimetallic seed particle top and from an iron oxide particle bottom with ic0 and ic1 respectively . if we again disregard the spurious copper peak ic0 contains iron and platinum x ray peaks ic1 iron and oxygen peaks and ic2 a single carbon peak figure 4i . being made from the same synthesis the composition of the bimetallic seed particles are expected to match to the composition of the bimetallic cores in the core shell particles analyzed in figure 4 .", "however these studies focused on analyzing acute effects of high glucose pre treatment and did not yet investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the phenomenon . cerasi and colleagues had previously reported time dependent potentiation of insulin secretion in that exposure of rat islets to high glucose 27.7 mm up to 60 min prior to the test stimulation with glucose increased subsequent insulin secretion . next we evaluated the kinetics of the cell response to acute glucose exposure and observed that the pulse group secreted more insulin at basal time zero and stimulatory concentrations of glucose 16.7 mm between 5 and 60 min following stimulation figure 1e . pulse treatment increased insulin secretion at basal 2.8 mm and stimulatory 16.8 mm glucose concentrations figure 2a . to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the glucose pulse paradigm induces memory in cells we evaluated the expression of essential mediators of the insulin secretory response . as was the case in min6 cells the pulse group showed increased camkii phosphorylation at both basal and stimulatory glucose concentrations figure 2b . importantly both the increases in basal and stimulated insulin secretion in the glucose pulse group were abolished by kn93 figure 1b a specific camkii inhibitor . as shown in figure 1b min6 cells exposed to the glucose pulse regimen showed higher insulin secretion both when exposed to low 2.8 mm or high 16.8 mm glucose than cells which had been cultured continuously at low glucose . a computer controlled fast performance hplc system allowed programmable rates of flow and concentrations of the appropriate solutions held in a 37 c water bath . indeed we find that cells retain memory of prior activation and describe the molecular mechanism that contributes to this memory . this increase in insulin secretion was accompanied by a significant rise in the levels of phosphorylated camkii consistent with the notion that camkii might be a molecular mediator of this metabolic memory figure 1c and d . in order to investigate metabolic memory of insulin producing cells we first had to develop a paradigm in which such memory was evident . islets from the glucose pulse group showed both increased first and second phase insulin secretion compared with islets from the control group figure 2c and d . thus min6 cells had acquired metabolic memory of prior exposure to glucose pulses which they retained through a 24h consolidation period . islets were perfused for 80 min with krbb in the absence of glucose followed by krbb with increasing concentrations of glucose glucose was ramped from 0 to 30 mm at 0.75 mm min . this process is accompanied by increased phosphorylation of camkii extended data figure 2 a process now shown to be part of the establishment of metabolic memory in cells . we also found using live cell calcium imaging of mouse islets that the increases in cytoplasmic calcium levels following acute glucose stimulation representing the penultimate step in insulin secretion are significantly higher in the pulse group compared with controls extended data figure 1c . camkii also participates in glucose stimulated insulin secretion gsis as multiple insulin secretagogues increase camkii activity . to this end we treated human islets with pulses of 30 mm kcl which causes membrane depolarization opening of voltage gated ca channels and insulin secretion without a prior increase in intracellular atp levels . in parallel the phosphorylation of camkii was higher in the glucose pulse group at both glucose concentrations and remained elevated even after the glucose concentration was reduced to 2.8 mm figure 1f . here we demonstrate that human and mouse pancreatic cells are able to acquire consolidate and retrieve information induced by high glucose exposure and determined that this ability is dependent on camkii .", "for its use as a classification of functional status relevant for health

associated with higher circulating il6 and hscrp levels in boys . we found that the gas6 rs8191973 or rs8191974 genotypes were not significantly associated with circulating gas6 protein levels in both the sexes . however the association between gas6 genotypes and circulating gas6 protein levels was not observed among adolescents . no statistically significant association between anthropometric

nivelles belgium . interestingly a previous study found that the a allele or the aa genotype of gas6 rs8191974 is associated with decreased risk of stroke . moreover boys with the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191974 had significantly higher bmi wc and hscrp levels than those carrying the a allele . in addition the association between circulating gas6 protein levels and gas6 polymorphisms was investigated . moreover the combination of gas6 and axl gene polymorphisms is not significantly associated with any variables in adiposity among adolescents . however the axl rs4802113 or rs2304232 polymorphisms showed no significant association with abnormal adiposity inflammatory markers and homa ir in boys or girls see supplemental table 5 . however combinations of gas6 markers with axl gene polymorphisms were not found to be significantly associated with any abnormal variables in both boys and girls data not shown . the risk of possessing high adiposity and inflammatory markers levels was higher in boys carrying the gg genotype with gas6 rs8191973 or rs8191974 than the noncarriers . however in girls axl rs4802113 or rs2304232 polymorphisms were not significantly associated with any anthropometric characteristics or biochemistry tables 3 and 4 . we also observed similar results in those with the a allele or aa genotype of gas6 rs8191974 . even after adjusting for age tanner stage smoking status drinking status and physical activity a significant relationship between the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191973 and higher hscrp levels was still observed in boys table 5 . however there were significantly different hscrp levels between gg ga and aa genotypes of gas6 rs8191974 in boys regardless of their age tanner stages smoking status drinking status or physical activity table 2 . in addition boys with the gg genotype of axl rs2304232 had significantly higher il6 and insulin levels and increased homa ir than those carrying the a allele table 4 . the gas6 rs819174 genotypes were not significantly associated with any anthropometric characteristics and biochemistry in girls . in conclusion we indicate an association between the gas6 and axl polymorphisms with adiposity circulating inflammatory markers and insulin resistance of adolescents especially in boys . in addition we evaluated the combined effect of the gas6 rs8191973 or rs8191974 marker with axl gene polymorphisms and its association with risk of high adiposity inflammatory marker and homa ir . in this study a strong association between gas6 and axl polymorphisms with body adiposity systemic

stronger risk factor for high adiposity inflammatory markers levels and homa ir than when alone . however for girls there was no statistically significant association between the combination of the gas6 rs8191974 and rs8191973 polymorphisms and abnormal variables . the p values of all comparisons between anthropometric and biochemistry data across axl genotypes were presented in supplemental

harvesting process . following the assessment of the main hypothesis of the research that is the effect of ovulation stimulation on women s mental health study results showed that ovulation stimulation does not affect mental health the level of depression and anxiety and the measure of psychological disorders in these two dimensions did not show a significant difference before the ovulation and after the harvesting process . but the level of depression and anxiety disorders at the beginning of ovulation stimulation was higher in the present research than other reports . the results of multi variable linear regression to evaluate the relation between underlying variables and mental health condition before starting the process with the level of depression and anxiety after the harvesting are shown in table 3 . the relation between mental health dimensions and background variables after ovulation stimulation the level of depression after egg harvesting was related to physical condition depression and social impairment independent from underlying variables . chicago il usa statistical paired t tests and multi variable linear regression tests . the present study aimed to assess the level of mental health in fertile women undergoing assisted reproductive treatments as a result of male factor infertility at the beginning of ovulation stimulation process and the effect of this process on their mental health . factors other than ovulation stimulation process which might influence the individuals levels of depression and anxiety have not been assessed in the present research . evaluating the related factors of depression and anxiety among iranian infertile couples showed that women who were infertile themselves showed higher levels of anxiety and depression than women with male factor infertility . another finding of this research was the existence of correlation between depression level after treatment process and anxiety level at the first stage while this correlation was observed between depression level after treatment process and anxiety level at the second stage . furthermore results showed that fertile women s level of depression and anxiety does not depend on the reaction of the ovary to the ovulation stimulation and as these women have no problem in ovarian response to ovulation stimulation their mental health depends more on other factors . this finding indicates that women who enter the process of treatment with a higher anxiety level are prone to a higher level of depression therefore necessary measures should be taken to prevent it . also the level of depression after egg harvesting was related to the economic condition it also showed a significant relation with social impairment and hypochondriasis table 3 . positive correlation between the level of depression and anxiety and other dimensions of experiences during infertility treatment might be accompanied with social impairment thus affecting the levels of depression and anxiety . with regards to the negative impact of anxiety and depression during the treatment on the result of assisted reproduction treatment it is necessary that this group of women would be examined before the treatment process since they are exposed to risks of mental health disorders and be treated in case of high levels of depression and anxiety . this study showed that fertile women who undergo assisted reproduction treatments do not start the treatment process in an appropriate mental health condition and this condition would continue during the whole process until egg harvesting .", "a recently published overview of the literature supports an assertion that age related changes in postural reactions may be related to vitamin d status mediated through either central nervous system integration or antigravity muscles as the effectors in postural responses . some studies report an increased rate of falls for both inside and outside falls 13 14 however significant seasonal variation in fall rates was not found in a three year study while in a second study seasonal variation in fall rates was reported in women but not in men . the aim of this study was to determine differences in static balance postural sway vitamin d incidence of falls and type of fall serially at the end of each season over a 12month period in older community living adults . mixed methods poisson regression was used to determine associations between falls fall injuries and postural balance and vitamin d. the association between postural balance and vitamin d and season was estimated using mixed methods linear regression adjusted for age gender and strength . overall there was no significant relationship found between postural sway and vitamin d. as increased postural sway is linked to low levels of vitamin d it may be that the levels of vitamin d were sufficient for this parameter even at their lowest levels in participants in this study and did not influence postural sway . the relationship of postural sway to any potential increased winter fall rate and decreased levels of vitamin d has not been investigated . our data indicates a higher rate of falls in summer than has previously been reported perhaps due to activity characteristics of our cohort . coincident static balance changes with any potential increased fall rates in winter have not been previously reported . balance impairment is an important fall risk factor and increases in range of postural sway in the mediolateral direction in older adults are associated with increased fall risk and rates . there was a significant relationship between postural sway and the number of injurious falls observed with lower values for sway range i.e. no associations between postural sway and vitamin d were observed all p 0.05 . for our generally healthy study population it is likely that our participants were engaged in outdoor activities with higher associated risk of falls during the warmer weather for example several summer falls occurred while bushwalking . annual cyclic trends were investigated by fitting a sine wave formula to data for postural sway and vitamin d with the amplitude of the seasonal variation in percentage change and the annual mean values were estimated using repeated measures nonlinear regression adjusted for age and gender . we hypothesised that postural sway falls and vitamin d would show a seasonal variation and that there would be an inverse relationship between vitamin d and the other variables . by contrast in winter out of doors fall rate was reduced to 64 indicating a higher winter time proportion of inside falls . this may be explained by the higher proportion of summer time falls observed in our study . for comparison seasonal data for falls was grouped into autumn and winter and compared to spring and summer . this is the first cohort study to determine that no seasonal variation of postural sway occurs across 12 months in our population . less injuries from falls were recorded in spring than any other season p 0.02 with no other seasonal differences recorded . this study provides important evidence for clinicians and researchers that postural sway remains stable over an annual cycle but may be influenced by a learning effect . this is the first study to investigate the effects of season and postural sway and found that postural sway remained stable over the 12 months . fracture rates from falls in older adults also increase at the end of the winter season following two to eight weeks after the nadir in serum vitamin d levels . the stability of this measure in a cohort across a year provides important information for researchers planning interventions designed to impact postural sway and clinicians who are measuring the effectiveness of their interventions . significant seasonal variation in serum vitamin d levels with higher serum levels in summer was recorded . annual rates of falling for adults over 65 have been reported up to 40 and although our cohort includes some adults between the ages of sixty and sixty five with a mean age of 69 years and a fall rate of thirty three percent our population appears to be representative of older community dwelling adults in terms of fall rate .", "alkaloids were extracted from the powder according to the procedure described by manske 14 . alkaloids were

blue structures obtained in the freely rotating molecular dynamics simulation . recently we have used computational methods to show that wild type gfp is not an anomaly and that all gfp and gfp like proteins in the protein databank have a protein matrix that is not complementary with a planar chromophore.54 in most cases the freely rotating chromophore undergoes rotations of at least 20. in some cases these rotations are accompanied by an equal but opposite rotation of the dihedral angle a negatively correlated ht . plot of the vs dihedral angles for the 2000 bfp blue and gfp a green structures obtained in the freely rotating molecular dynamics simulation . plot of the vs dihedral angles see figure 1 for nomenclature for the 2000 structures obtained in the freely rotating molecular dynamics simulation of gfp dark blue and yfp pink in their phenolic forms . in yfp the chromophore has approximately 1.2 times more dihedral freedom than in gfp and although the dihedrals undergo negatively correlated hula twisting in both proteins in yfp the average conformation sampled is further from planarity than that found in gfp i.e. figure 5 and table 1 show that the chromophore in bfp has significantly more rotational freedom than that available to the chromophore in gfp and that the bfp cavity is less complementary to a planar chromophore than the gfp cavity is that is the bfp sampled structures are further from a planar chromophore 0 and the intercept for the best fit line through the bfp structures is further from the origin than that of gfp . they found the energy minimum conformation of a freely rotating chromophore in the protein matrix of the gfp mutant or gfp like protein examined however they did not provide any information about the range of low energy conformations available to a freely rotating chromophore . plot of the vs dihedral angles for the 2000 bfp dark blue and a5 pink structures obtained in the freely rotating molecular dynamics simulation . in all simulations the protein matrix is not complementary with a planar chromophore and in all cases the freely rotating chromophore undergoes a negatively correlated hula twist also known as a bottom hula twist mechanism . while the ground state minimum of the gfp chromophore is close to planar this is not necessarily so for the excited state in fact in some cases the excited state has an energy minimum with a twisted chromophore in which both rings are 90 to each other.32 according to quantum mechanical calculations the ground and excited states for the one bond flip obf and hula twist ht in the neutral form a and the obf in the zwitterionic form come very close to each other . as shown in figure 2 gfp adopts two states the neutral state a of the chromophore with the phenolic oxygen protonated and the anionic species b the change from forms a to i is solely a protonation change while the change from i to b is a conformational change with most changes occurring at thr203.67 in order to see whether the gfp chromophore has different dihedral freedom in forms a b and i we conducted molecular dynamical simulations with a freely rotating chromophore as described in the .", "2 . . in our study we demonstrated the effective use of diff quik stained direct smears for this purpose and observed that the performance of this assay using direct smears was better than the performance using cell blocks . we have previously demonstrated that uncoverslipped and previously coverslipped decoverslipped diff quik stained smears are robust sources of cellular material for pcr based mutational analysis such as egfr mutation testing of lung adenocarcinoma and braf mutation testing of metastatic melanoma fna specimens . therefore the utilization of both diff quik and papanicolaou stained smears are feasible analytes for alk fish . however there can be exceptions to this and clinical characteristics should not be used to exclude lung cancer patients for alk rearrangement testing . multiple groups have successfully demonstrated the utilization of cytologic direct smears for egfr mutation testing of lung adenocarcinomas 2925 36 with low failure rates and high degree of concordance with egfr molecular testing results from corresponding histologic specimens when available . recently given the shortcomings of cell blocks there has been an increasing appreciation of alternative cytopreparatory platforms for molecular testing such as direct smears and lbc samples . given the continuously evolving landscape in our understanding of the genetic events responsible for lung cancer pathogenesis the integration between anatomic pathology particularly cytopathology and molecular diagnostics will become even more essential . our preference in utilizing diff quik stained smears over papanicolaou stained smears is rooted in the following observations 1 cellular material on a diff quik stained smear can be easily visualized without a coverslip and immediately triaged for molecular diagnostic testing and 2 the report by killian et al . also examined the use of papanicolaou stained direct smears and observed that the failure rate due to insufficient cellularity was significantly higher for cell blocks than for direct smears . the cell suspension can be divided and an aliquot is used to prepare a thinprep slide that is stained via the papanicolaou method similar to alcohol fixed papanicolaou stained direct smears . tumor cells can be isolated from the thinprep slide and used for dna isolation and egfr mutation analysis . however these are not absolute rules and clinical characteristics should not be used to exclude lung cancer patients from mutation testing . cytologic direct smears may ultimately prove to be the cytologic platform best suited for pcr based analysis due to the high quality of nucleic acids and immediate nature of specimen assessment for tumor cell adequacy . thus if one or more needle passes are high in tumor cell content whereas other needle passes contain a high proportion of benign cellular elements the tumor cells in the final pooled cell suspension will be diluted . these mutations are more commonly associated with east asian ethnicity female gender and non smoking history . with respect to the latter point others have pointed out that papanicolaou stained smears are just as feasible for pcr based molecular tests . based on the findings in the diff quik stained smears the determination can be made to perform additional needle passes to obtain more tumor cells for diagnosis andor anticipated ancillary studies while the patient is still accessible . at our institution we utilize a multiplex pcr fragment analysis assay for egfr mutation testing this allows for the simultaneous assessment of the two most commonly observed egfr mutations fig . directly compared the performance of egfr mutation analysis by sanger sequencing using paired samples for each case analyzed 1 pelleted cells from the cytolyt suspension and 2 tumor cells obtained from the thinprep slide via lcm . immunohistochemistry using the d5f3 and 5a4 monoclonal antibodies on cytologic specimens have been recently described and shown to exhibit a high degree of concordance with alk fish testing . similar to the needle rinse cell suspension utilized to prepare cell blocks the cytolyt cell suspension is a pooled specimen if multiple needle passes are expelled and rinsed into cytolyt . finally the application of reverse transcriptase pcr rt pcr to cytologic direct smears for alk rearrangement analysis has been recently reported . as mentioned previously paraffin embedded cell blocks are processed similarly to paraffin embedded tissue blocks thus cell blocks are traditionally used for the performance of alk rearrangement fish assays . egfr mutations are predominantly observed in lung adenocarcinomas the l858r substitution and small in frame deletions in exon 19 are the most commonly observed mutations and account for up to 90 of all egfr mutations in this setting . thus if one or more needle passes contain tumor cells but other needle passes contain abundant benign background cellular elements the tumor cells will be diluted by these benign cells in the cell block . that nucleic acids extracted from diff quik stained smears show better preservation and integrity than dna extracted from papanicolaou stained smears . the advantage of utilizing cytologic preparation platforms such as direct smears and thinprep slides for this purpose is that entire tumor cell nuclei are being analyzed . lbc samples have also been investigated for egfr mutation testing and have been shown to be an effective analyte for this purpose . furthermore the cell suspension aliquot that is not used to prepare a thinprep slide can be centrifuged and the cell pellet itself can be used as an analyte for mutation testing 38 40 . while egfr mutations and alk rearrangements represent the two best characterized clinically actionable molecular alterations in nsclc other molecular markers are becoming increasingly appreciated and investigated . at our institution if the subtyping of nsclc is deemed to be challenging based on cytomorphologic evaluation alone immunocytochemistry is utilized we have demonstrated that this can be accomplished using smears as well as cell blocks . the contents of each needle pass are expelled onto a slide which is utilized to prepare direct smears . the needle contents are rinsed in the rpmi solution without the preparation of smears for those needle passes obtained for the cell block preparation . as mentioned previously ffpe cell blocks represent the traditional cytopreparatory platform on which ancillary molecular diagnostic tests are performed . this can be problematic in both small biopsy and cytology specimens especially cell blocks in which the tumor cell population can be diluted by background benign cellular elements such as inflammatory cells bronchial epithelial cells andor stromal mesenchymal cells . thus we and others have investigated alternative cytopreparatory platforms for alk fish . the immunohistochemical approach to detecting mutant egfr proteins using these antibodies has been examined in several studies on lung cancer tissues as well as cytologic and small biopsy samples 42 48 . most alk rearrangements in lung adenocarcinoma result from interstitial deletions and small inversions within the short arm of chromosome 2 . nonetheless there is an observed noticeable failure rate when using and relying on cell blocks for these assays due to insufficient tumor cell material in a significant proportion of cases .", "1 3 . 1 3 . comparing survival among the different histologies tnet had a

sarcopenia and proinflammatory cytokines including tnf and il6 as the central mediators of skeletal muscle atrophy has been documented the roles of inflammatory mirnas in mass maintenance and functional development of skeletal muscle still need to be further explored and confirmed . accumulating evidences over the past decade have demonstrated that those proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf il6 and c reactive protein crp cause a significant increase in aging skeletal muscle cells and play a key role in the complex network of inflammatory signals in charge of muscle homeostasis connected with aging related disability and mortality 31 32 . in turn inflammation aggravates muscle loss and fat accumulation in the aging skeletal muscle and further decreases muscle function and physical activity . in order to elucidate which mirna is important in the production of proinflammatory cytokines in aging related muscle wasting mrna targets and specific roles in regeneration and protein synthesis in skeletal muscle need to be established . tnf is a cytokine implicated in the metabolic disturbance of chronic inflammation with the formation of il1 which has been identified as a circulatory factor to increase gluconeogenesis lipolysis and proteolysis accompanied with the decrease in protein lipid and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle . whether mirnas can be used for the diagnosis of inflammatory involvement in the aging process of skeletal muscle proinflammatory cytokine associated mirnas such as mir146a mir181 and mir21 are frequently detected at a high level in skeletal muscle however their functions are still not fully clear . in conclusion the discovery of mirnas with regulatory capacity of inflammatory response during aging process of skeletal muscle will open a novel avenue for the diagnosis prevention and therapy of sarcopenia through effectively modulating inflammatory signal pathways . given that the inflammatory response is a complex system cytokines are important not only as the indicators for mediating chronic inflammatory state through increasing protein degradation and reducing protein synthesis but also as the mediators for controlling muscle wasting by directly targeting muscle tissue . also tnf and il1 have been confirmed to promote il6 secretion through activating nfb in cultured skeletal muscle cells . tnf induces skeletal muscle loss through increased myofibrillar protein degradation and cell apoptosis thus resulting in muscle atrophy and the inhibition of muscle regeneration following injury 55 56 . a comparative analysis of cytokine levels has confirmed the upregulation of proinflammatory il6 and crp in the elderly along with increased risk for the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength . the chronic inflammatory aging process depends not only on increased expression of proinflammatory factors but also on reduced levels of anti inflammatory factors such as il10 one of the anti inflammatory cytokines . il6 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases including sarcopenia by regulating inflammatory and metabolic functions .", "it is important for the population

found a positive correlation between hs crp levels and all glycaemia and ir parameters . in women s health study the incidence of dm was four times higher in women with hs crp levels in the upper quartile in comparison with those with hs crp levels in the lowest quartile . however the highest hs crp among people with new dm was found in those identified with the hba1c criterion . in contrast men with newly detected dm based on fpg criterion had lower mean hs crp than those diagnosed with 2hpg p 0.017 and hba1c p 0.003 but mean hs crp levels were comparable in 2hpg and hba1c based new dm

first study aiming at determining hs crp cut off points indicating new dm compared with each of the three methods assessing hyperglycaemia . the optimum cut point for hba1c 6.5 and over was 2.9 mg l 27.5 nmol l in women with a 65 sensitivity and 64 specificity and 2.0 mg l 19.0 nmol l in men with a 60 sensitivity and 62 specificity and the largest auc value for hs crp to detect new dm was found

when we repeated the analysis after controlling for ht age sex smoking and alcohol use bmi and waist circumference the positive correlations between hs crp levels and hba1c 1hpg 2hpg tg non hdl cholesterol egfr and homa ir and the negative correlation with hdl cholesterol and creatinine remained significant table 2 . in our previous report we demonstrated a linear increasing trend for hs crp levels from normal glucose tolerance through impaired fasting glucose ifg igt and new dm . the specificity and sensitivity of the optimal cut off points for hs crp to detect dm in women were for the fpg group 60 and 57 for 2.5 mg l 23.6 nmol l 2hpg group 60 and 54 for 2.1 mg l 19.7 nmol l and 65 and 64 for hba1c group 2.9 mg l 27.5 nmol l . other studies have also shown an association between crp and dm which remained significant after adjusting for bmi or other covariates . the relationship between the development of dm and some markers of inflammation such as c reactive protein crp il6 fibrinogen and pai1 has been described previously . in the present study we excluded people with known systemic disease and those who self reported regularly using such medications however we may not ascertain all people using aspirin andor statin . in another study performed in a japanese population a cut off point of hs crp of 0.65 mg l 6.2 nmol l for fpg 100 mg dl 5.6 mmol l or higher was capable of defining the ms with a 100 sensitivity and 77 specificity in women and with a 65 sensitivity and 63 specificity in men . on the other hand hyperglycaemia per se may induce inflammation and this may enhance the development of dm 21 22 . several studies have suggested that inflammation is associated with ir that takes part in the pathogenesis of t2 dm and atherosclerotic disease 14 6 . as we did show a positive correlation between hs crp and hba1c it has been reported that people with dm with poorer glycaemic control had higher crp levels . women with newly detected dm based on 2hpg

". . enzyme activity measurements and inhibition studies revealed a key role of nox ne and mpo in eimeria triggered net formation see table 1 which is in agreement to bacterial fungal and parasitic pathogens 14 25 59 65 75 110 . the colocalization of ne histones and mpo with dna in parasite mediated extracellular fibres proved classical characteristics of nets and inhibitor experiments emphasized the key role of ne nox and mpo in efficient net formation . as equally reported for several other coccidian parasites 14 23 t. gondii induced nets were also proven to be nox ne mpo and ca soce dependent and to be mediated by an erk 12related signalling pathway in pmn see table 1 25 26 . although all eimeria species tested so far equally induced nets significant differences in entrapment effectivity were reported amongst different host species parasite species and stages . accordingly reduced host cell infections rates were reported for e. bovis and e. arloingi sporozoites when previously exposed to pmn 23 24 . using extracellular dna measurements and dnase treatments other studies confirmed typical characteristics of nets such as the colocalization of ne mpo and histones in the dna backbone of eimeria induced net like structures . showed that netosis was triggered by tachyzoites in a parasite strain independent fashion as an invasion phagocytosis independent process . consistently harbour seal pmn promoted nets significantly hampered host cell invasion of t. gondii tachyzoites in vitro . during this early rapid leishmania triggered netosis in which net formation takes place after 515 min of activation without affecting pmn viability 29 68 the parasites are also being efficiently entrapped . besnoitia besnoiti triggered netosis furthermore proved as vitality independent process that was even induced by soluble parasite molecules homogenates though at lower levels . by antibody mediated cd11b blockage leading to a significant reduction of parasite triggered netosis bacteria and fungi netosis was reported as a lethal effector mechanism 31 42 . in vitro infection experiments additionally showed the negative impact of nets on host cell invasion since infection rates were significantly reduced when using pmn preexposed c. parvum stages . interestingly in the murine toxoplasmosis model tachyzoites induced nets were not the result of a random cell lysis but of a controlled dna release process since lysozyme was still present in pmn after performing netosis 25 120 . 4 years after the discovery of this novel effector mechanism and reported on plasmodium falciparum triggered net formation . taking into account that in most cases et formation is considered as a species and stage independent process rather ubiquitary occurring molecules may represent parasite derived target molecules of ets . exposure of harbour seal derived monocytes to viable t. gondii tachyzoites resulted in a significant induction of monocyte ets and tachyzoites were firmly entrapped and immobilised within harbour seal monocyte et structures hampering parasite replication . net formation is primarily a nox dependent mechanism 14 24 59 75 76 . recently reported on infection induced upregulation of endothelial derived il8 and p selectin gene transcription and furthermore presented indications on net formation occurring adjacent to infected endothelium after pmn adhesion assays being performed under physiological flow conditions as the ones present in small vessels . particularly pmn have been implicated in the immunopathogenesis of leishmaniasis 145149 and recent studies examined the potential role of nets during the early phase of the disease of different leishmania species . however killing effects of nets were not observed in the case of eimeria spp . thus respective enzyme activities were encountered in tachyzoite exposed pmn and chemical blockage of these enzymes via inhibitors blocked parasite triggered netosis 28 59 . besnoitia besnoiti tachyzoites were recently reported as effective inducers of pmn and monocyte derived ets figures 1e 1g and 1h 28 59 . as such the first ever published study on parasite triggered netosis was published in 2008 by baker et al . importantly muoz caro and colleagues proved nets also to occur in vivo in eimeria infected gut mucosa . however nox independent netosis was also reported 29 60 67 68 77 . referring to ca influx further inhibition experiments proved e. bovis mediated netosis as dependent on intracellular ca mobilization since 2abp inhibitor of store operated ca entry and bapta am binding intracellular ca muoz caro unpublished data but not egta inhibitor of ca influx from the extracellular compartment muoz caro unpublished data significantly blocked parasite triggered netosis . several studies showed that pmn infiltrate intestinal mucosa in response to eimeria infections and are occasionally found in close contact to the parasitic stages in vivo 102 104107 . besides e. bovis e. arloingi silva unpublished data and e. ninakohlyakimovae prez et al . with the upregulation of the genes transcription encoding for il12 and tnf relevant immunoregulatory cytokines with transition properties into the adaptive immunity were also demonstrated in e. ninakohlyakimovae exposed caprine monocytes prez et al submitted manuscript . in addition calcium release is needed for optimal net formation in different vertebrate species 14 23 7072 . during the acute phase of cattle besnoitiosis b. besnoiti tachyzoites mainly replicate in host endothelial cells of different organs 28 128 and upon release may be exposed to circulating leukocytes . in the presence of lundep measured the ne release from nets as an indicator of net destruction since ne is normally decorating nets backbone structures and found at low concentrations in culture supernatants as previously demonstrated . infections with leishmania spp . the first report on p. falciparum induced nets referred to p. falciparum infected children and demonstrated in vivo net entrapped trophozoite infected erythrocytes in blood samples . regarding pmn derived effector molecules nox ne and mpo proved as essential for efficient b. besnoiti triggered netosis . the types of granules to be found in circulating pmn depend on their maturation stage . the current data suggest that eimeria induced netosis is a species and stage independent mechanism since it was induced by sporozoites merozoites i or oocysts of different eimeria species 23 24 . pmn have also been shown to directly interact with e. bovis stages and antigens in vitro resulting in release of proinflammatory cytokines chemokines and inos . verified that pmn which had released nets were still viable and retained their capability to engulf bacteria via phagocytosis . following granule maturation pmn will possess all three types of granules displaying full killing capacity not only in the blood but also in tissues organs and gut lumen . this mode of netosis is accompanied by a substantially lower level of erk activation and rather moderate level of akt activation whereas activation of p38 is similar in both kinds of net formation 67 68 . in agreement with findings on eimeria induced netosis inhibition experiments revealed c. parvum triggered net formation as dependent on intracellular ca release and erk 12 and p38 mapk mediated signalling pathways . it is well known that macrophages eosinophils monocytes and pmn are implicated in the control of early infection 30 155 . referring to signal cascades analyses on the grade of phosphorylation revealed a key role of erk12 and p38 mapk in sporozoite exposed bovine pmn . beginning with the landmark study of brinkmann et al . as an example irrespectively of nox dependency pathogens may either be immobilised within sticky dna fibres 55 78 79 or be killed via the local high concentration of effector molecules 31 42 51 53 . however leishmania lipophosphoglycan lpg dependent net induction reported by guimares costa et al . the content of primary granules includes myeloperoxidase mpo neutrophil elastase ne cathepsin g proteinase 3 defensins and lysozyme secondary granules contain collagenase gelatinase cystatin lysozyme and lactoferrin and tertiary granules comprise gelatinase lysozyme and arginase amongst others . while a bunch of data is available on bacterial nucleases or other counter mechanisms taken together we call for more parasite related studies in the exciting field of etosis . il8 and tnf 140 141 and may have potentiated net reactions . described already many years ago that enucleated pmn may remain vital and are even capable of killing invasive microbes . the paradigm of how pmn fight and kill pathogenic bacteria has profoundly been changed . since respective inhibitor experiments led to decreased parasite mediated net formation muoz caro et al . parasites of the genus eimeria are worldwide of high veterinary and economic importance in livestock especially in chicken cattle and small ruminants 95100 . reported netosis as a ros dependent process which was equally triggered in human and murine pmn see table 1 .", "the national tb prevalence survey in eritrea was conducted from february through october 2005 6 . two explanations may account for the large difference 1 the cdr derived from the tb prevalence survey is

suggests that california adolescents who are uninsured or who qualify for low cost free insurance are at greatest risk for overweight or obesity yet a recent national study found that adolescents with private insurance generally receive more counseling compared to those who have low cost insurance . based on self reported data 28.7 of california adolescents were either overweight or obese while 48.2 of all california adolescents received counseling on both nutrition and exercise subjects table 1 . those who had private insurance generally received exercise counseling more frequently than nutrition counseling over the study time period . when examining nutrition or exercise counseling separately during the study period 20032009 interesting differences were found by race ethnicity hispanic and african american chis adolescents generally reported higher levels of nutrition than exercise counseling while whites generally reported higher levels of exercise than nutrition counseling . data demonstrating trends in nutrition and exercise counseling by race ethnicity and by insurance type were obtained using four biennial california health interview surveys 20032009 the largest state surveys in the united states . when examining nutrition or exercise counseling separately for the period from 2003 to 2009 african americans generally reported higher levels of nutrition than exercise counseling while whites generally reported higher levels of exercise than nutrition counseling . this is the first study to examine trends in obesity related counseling by race ethnicity and by insurance type among california adolescents . meanwhile participants who had private insurance generally received more exercise than nutrition counseling during the study period . previous research in california suggests that physician obesity related counseling has been declining with overall counseling rates between 2003 and 2007 shifting from 75 to 59 for nutrition and 74 to 60 for physical activity . counseling appeared to decline from 20032009 among all insurance types although after 2007 a slight increase was observed for the low cost free insurance group . the objectives of this current study were to document trends from 2003 to 2009 in either nutrition or exercise counseling or a combination of both among california adolescents by race ethnicity and by insurance type . figure 2 and table 3 present data for obesity related counseling stratified by insurance type . time trend findings from 2003 to 2009 indicate that nutrition and exercise counseling decreased for all racial ethnic groups except for hispanics and whites for whom it started to increase after 2007 . further we hypothesized that physicians would favor dietary counseling over exercise counseling when providing counseling . the higher counseling levels reported in this study compared with national figures may have been due to fewer barriers or more public health awareness of the obesity epidemic in california and stronger health care leadership . among those who were uninsured counseling declined from 70.8 to 42.2 among the low cost free group counseling declined from 64 to 53.4 among the employer group counseling declined from 61.8 to 46.6 and among the private insurance group counseling declined from 58.9 to 39.8 figure 2 . there appeared to be no imbalance in frequency of nutrition or exercise counseling for the uninsured low cost free or employer based groups except in 2003 when adolescents who were underinsured or had low cost insurance reported more nutrition than physical activity counseling . figure 1 and table 2 present data for obesity related counseling stratified by race ethnicity . as early as the 1950s the american medical association council on food and nutrition cited the benefits of nutrition counseling as well as inadequacies in nutrition education in u.s . however little is known about the frequency of weight related counseling given to different racial ethnic groups or those with limited access to care over the course of treating or preventing obesity in the health care environment . some groups that need obesity prevention counseling the most may still be missing out including american indians alaska natives african americans and the uninsured .", "to compare results the chi square test and mann whitney u test were used . first

manner . in our study the maximum number of teeth treated in the 4 year was four cases by 66.7 of the students while the maximum number of teeth treated in 5 year was 11 cases by 8.8 of the students . fourth and fifth year dental students at taibah university saudi arabia are confident regarding root canal treatment although they report lower confidence in some steps of the root canal treatment process . fourth year students were more confident than 5year students in the following determining the working length dealing with x rays during root canal treatment evaluating root canal obturation and recalling patient at the correct time . there is a one semester clinical endodontic course in the 4 year that consists of 14 theoretical lectures and fourteen 3h clinical sessions during which students treat single and multi rooted teeth . this study obtained information about the confidence of undergraduate dental students at taibah university saudi arabia regarding endodontics . the number of teeth treated by students in the 4 and 5 year did not meet the recommendations of the european society of endodontology 2001 guidelines which advised that for adequate competency a student should complete root canal treatments in 20 teeth . introducing advances in endodontics into undergraduate training such as niti rotary instruments may improve the clinical experience of students and their self confidence because it will help increase the numbers of cases treated . it revealed that an upper incisor 78 was the most common tooth first treated by students . dental students at taibah university saudi arabia take a preclinical full year endodontic course in the 3 year of their 6year bachelor of dental surgery degree . this study enrolled 41 undergraduate dental students registered

expected the observed anti ena andor anti dsdna reactivity of ana positive sera in the secondary care 39 is higher than in the primary care . in the present study on the analyses of ana prevalence ana titre and anti ena specificity in the primary secondary and tertiary care our results indicate that i ana prevalence significantly increases from primary to tertiary care ii low titres 1 80 are more frequently observed in the primary care and iii anti ena and anti dsdna specificities are significantly more prevalent in the secondary care than in the primary care . cardiology requested 108 ana tests 9.2 revealing 13 ana positive results of which 20 was anti ena andor anti dsdna antibody positive . we hypothesize that ana prevalence ana titre and anti ena dsdna reactivity increase from primary to tertiary care as these situations are expected to be also associated with an increasing pretest probability of sard . the latter difference might at least explain the lower relative prevalence of anti ena and anti dsdna antibodies in the rheumatology department of the tertiary care hospital . surprisingly anti ena andor anti dsdna reactivity in the tertiary care 21 is lower than in the secondary care and similar to the primary care . in the primary care 19 21.1 patients with positive ana n 90 were tested positive for anti ena andor anti dsdna antibodies that is 1.3 of the total cohort . significantly more positive anti ena andor anti dsdna results were found in the total secondary and tertiary care cohorts than in the primary care cohort p 0.0001 and p 0.0006 resp . this risk of false positive interpretation will decrease if the positive ana is characterized by high titre and includes multireactivity for ena andor dsdna since these characteristics are associated with higher positive likelihood ratios 11 12 17 . in the case of small samples of the three patient populations included 90 6.2 175 10.8 and 187 16.0 patients from primary n 1453 secondary n 1621 and tertiary care n 1168 respectively were tested positive for ana and were therefore eligible for the current study . all ana requests were considered to involve the diagnostic workup since none of the patients had requests for ana andor anti ena dsdna at least 4 years prior to the study period . this study however also has noteworthy strengths that is only data obtained during the diagnostic workup of patients not follow up samples were included and the same testing algorithm and reagents except for detection of anti dsdna antibodies were used for all three patient cohorts . altogether the results indicate that in the primary care the usage of traditional ana screening tests is more prone to false interpretation of positive ana results . in the secondary and tertiary care 68 of 175 38.9 and 40 of 187 21.4 ana positive patients revealed anti ena andor anti dsdna reactivity respectively . besides data on ana prevalence also ana titres and anti ena and anti dsdna antibodies were included in our analyses . fitc conjugated goat anti human igg antibody was used for detection of anti dsdna antibodies . in our secondary and tertiary cohorts the ana prevalence is also relatively low 11 and 16 resp . if a homogenous ana pattern was detected testing for anti dsdna antibodies was performed by feia primary and secondary care or clift tertiary care . another alternative testing algorithm could instead of ana iif include solid phase assays including multiplex and screening assays for well defined anti ena and anti dsdna reactive antibodies 11 12 26 27 . on the other hand due to the high negative predictive value of a negative ana result furthermore since both high titre and anti ena andor anti dsdna multireactivity may increase the likelihood of identifying a patient with sard 11 12 17 it is apparent in our primary care cohort that 30 of ana positive sera are of medium to high titre n 27 21 contain anti ena andor anti dsdna reactivity n 19 and 37 of the latter reveal multireactivity n 7 . interpretation of a positive ana test may be different for each distinct disease patients with for instance aih or systemic sclerosis often have a positive ana with no ena reactivity while a positive ana test as such is part of the classification criteria for sle as well as aih 68 . since the relevance of anti ena and anti dsdna antibodies is considered to increase when combined reactivity is observed we analysed the prevalence of anti ena andor anti dsdna antibodies in relation to combined reactivity figure 3b . within the positive ana cohorts patients from primary care had relatively low titres out of 90 positive ana tests 63 sera 70 revealed an ana titre of 1 80 . this result may help the clinician to identify a patient with sard but especially in situations with low pretest probabilities of such diseases the risk of false interpretation of a positive ana is high . in secondary and tertiary care a titre of 1 consequently higher titres were observed more frequently in secondary and tertiary care than in primary care . this approach sustains recognition of sard related autoantibodies in sera with combined reactivities that is anti dfs70 and other anti ena antibodies . our study shows that in secondary care the majority of positive ana results 92.6 as well as the positive anti ena and anti dsdna results 95.6 are linked to the departments of rheumatology dermatology internal medicine and neurology . anti scl70 antibodies were only detected in samples of patients from secondary and tertiary care . but in both clinical settings about half of the ana positive sera are of high titre 48 49 . ana detection by iif was performed on hep2000 cells according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer immuno concepts sacramento ca . this is 4.2 and 3.4 of the total secondary and tertiary care cohorts respectively p 0.367 . fitc conjugated goat anti human igg antibody was used for detection of ana . the presence of anti ena antibodies was screened by a commercially available line immunoassay ana 3 profile euroline euroimmun lbeck germany . in primary and secondary care anti dsdna antibodies were detected with a commercially available feia elia immunodiagnostics thermo fisher scientific . a second important difference is the presence of a division of clinical immunology within the department of internal medicine of the tertiary care hospital implying that many patients with sard are evaluated by clinical immunologists instead of rheumatologists . the assay was performed according to the manufacturer s instructions and as described for the anti ena antibodies . in a clinical setting where the pretest probability of sard is generally low as in primary care the added value of a positive ana test is lower as compared to secondary and tertiary care situations where pretest probabilities of sard are often higher . similarly anti cenp b antibodies were considered positive when a centromere ana pattern was observed in combination with a positive anti cenp b result in at least one of both anti ena antibody test systems . with respect to the antigens recognized by the specific antibodies no apparent differences were observed in the prevalence of antibodies reactive to rnp ssa60 ro52 ssb cenp b and dsdna figure 3c . the assumption of the primary care having a relatively low pretest probability was based on previous studies 13 18 19 . rather an alternative testing algorithm for detection of patients with sard might be more appropriate .", "2 . 1 . 1 . 1 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 1 . although para aortic

by other immune cells 1113 . toll like receptors are expressed on cells of the immune system but there is growing evidence that tlrs are also expressed on tumor cells where they may influence tumor growth and host immune responses . tlr signaling critical for innate and adaptive immune responses has been thought to be restricted to immune cells . however many studies suggest that tumor cells bear tlrs and that tlr signaling promotes tumor growth and immune evasion 1517 . tlrs are critical in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses and play a significant role in cancer immunosurveillance . studies on knockout mouse indicate that there is less redundancy in tlrs in relation to inflammation . macrophages and dendritic cells dcs in particular function as major sensors of invading pathogens and transformed cells via the tlrs . the general expression of functionally active tlrs by tumor cells and inflammatory cells in the stroma by putative endogenous ligands suggests that tlr signaling may be continually activated and may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis . there are several studies which suggest that damp mediated inflammation plays a vital role . in the tumor microenvironment inflammatory cells and molecules influence almost every aspect of cancer progress including the metastatic ability of tumor cells . activation of tlrs expressed on tumor cells may have profound consequences for tumor growth by factors released after tlr activation . sites of chronic inflammation are often associated with the establishment and growth of various malignancies including breast cancer . host cells including inflammatory cells endothelial cells and fibroblasts are recruited and activated in the microenvironment of transformed cells . a major source of inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment are specialized white blood cells called macrophages . tumor associated macrophages assist the malignant behaviour of tumor cells not only by producing cytokines but also by secreting growth factors and matrix degrading enzymes 3638 . there is strong evidence that the tumor microenvironment is inflammatory and that activation of the innate immune system plays a role in the progression of cancer 34 35 . tumors with high tlr3 expression by tumor cell or with high tlr4 expression by mononuclear inflammatory cells mics but not tlr9 high fibroblast like cells were significantly associated with higher probability of metastasis . as tlrs are widely expressed on tumor cells and immune cells and play important roles in the initiation and progression of cancer they may thus serve as an important target and have an effective perspective on breast cancer treatment .", "abo blood grouping for pulp and dentine rh factor grouping for

the findings from a study conducted in libya where researchers reported higher prevalence in the liver than in the lung and al khalid 1998 cited by dakkak who showed that in libya 75 of the positive bovine hydatidosis cases were in the liver and 37.5 in the lung and 12.5 in the spleen . furthermore the findings in this study were in agreement with that observed in a study done in sudan which reported a prevalence of 3 in cattle . there was variation in prevalence of hydatidosis according to the district of origin where cattle coming from mongu had the highest prevalence of cyst positive cases 2.5 compared to senanga 2.1 kalabo 1.4 and lukulu 0.6 table 3 . out of a total of 19 hydatid cyst infested organs that were investigated 15 lungs and 4 livers for cyst fertility viability and density it was found that the lung had a higher average density of cysts infestation 7 cysts per lung table 4 while the liver had a low hydatid cyst density 4 cysts per liver . the study was conducted as a two tier study involving a prospective abattoir survey and a retrospective review of meat inspection reports at zambeef and starbeef abattoirs in mongu . a review of the postmortem records over an eleven year period revealed that the distribution of hydatid cysts in bovine was highest in lung at 93.47 95 ci 92.7594.14 followed by liver at 6.55 95 ci 5.887.29 and spleen with the lowest at 0.02 95 ci 0.000.12 prevalence . however ibrahim found a higher fertility rate in liver at 38.8 than in the lung at 25.1 and so did dalimi et al . who reported a higher fertility rate in the liver than in the lung . information collected included number of cattle slaughtered breed and type of organs condemned number and weight of condemned organs . the lungs however have a larger capillary bed than any other organs and this could account for the observed higher prevalence than seen in the other organs . cysts viability study revealed that the overall percentage of viable cyst in this study was 43.5 which is comparable to findings by other researchers like ibrahim who found cyst viability of 47.8 in sheep and 24 in goats . the number of hydatid cysts that were examined in the lung was 108 while in the liver was 16 . the number of hydatid cysts that were examined in the lung was 108 while in the liver it was 16 . the slaughtered cattle were subjected to thorough postmortem inspection and lesioned organs were identified and samples were collected . infections in cattle for both prospective and retrospective data was determined as proportion of the test positive subjects against the total number tested . the aim of this was to provide baseline information and a retrospective understanding of the prevalence dynamics and spatial distribution of the disease in western province and also to estimate the annual economic loss due to organ condemnation . further dog access to slaughterhouse waste in mongu abattoirs is likely to increase exposure of both cattle and dogs in the district . in iran who observed that the prevalence was higher in females than males . this was on the basis of the average price of wholesome and intact visceral organs obtained from zambeef and starbeef abattoirs mongu . in view of the extensive livestock wildlife interface areas in the province furthermore a study in small ruminants such as sheep and goats may improve epidemiological understanding of the disease in zambia . a retrospective study was carried out based on a review of postmortem reports findings during meat inspection at the abattoirs in the last eleven years 19942007 . there is an increased dog and cattle interaction due to high populations and free range rearing of cattle which are often herded by boys with dogs this increases contact of cattle with dog faeces . out of this 84 2.1 carcasses table 3 were diagnosed positive for hydatidosis during postmortem inspections . each animal that was slaughtered was uniquely identified using stock movement permits that included the veterinary camp of origin in the district and further information was obtained by interviewing the owner . this is in agreement with what was reported by getaw et al . during this period 158 456 bovines were slaughtered and inspected and 4689 cases of bovine hydatidosis were recorded table 2 . this study was conducted between october 2007 and october 2008 at zambeef and starbeef abattoirs in mongu district . the total annual loss could be greater than the estimated amount bearing in mind that this only took into account direct losses and not indirect losses as a result of weight loss due to ce and other losses such as reduced milk production and reduction in reproduction in cattle . a retrospective study was carried out based on a review of postmortem report findings during meat inspection at the abattoirs over a period of eleven years from 1994 to 2007 with exemption of 1997 1998 and 2002 where data was missing . livestock and dog echinococcosis prevalence studies and surveillance can help map out ce risk landscape profiles that will determine communities at greatest risk to human ce . sex was found to be positively associated with hydatidosis p 0.035 with female cattle being more likely to test positive than males . however this could not be fully ascertained due to absence of trace back information during the period under review . the study was conducted in western province of zambia from october 2007 to november 2008 . sex was found to be positively associated with hydatidosis p 0.035 with female cattle being more likely to test positive than males odds ratio 1.62 . in this study we investigated the prevalence of hydatidosis based on pm findings at two abattoirs in western province of zambia . the observed prevalence of hydatid cysts in cattle sampled at the two abattoirs in mongu was found to be low 2.1 and was comparable to that observed during the retrospective survey 3.0 . on the other hand hydatidosis was independent of age p 0.31 where the mean age among the positives was 7.8 years range 7.47.6 and that among the negatives was 7.5 years range 7.38.3 . this could probably be due to the various metabolic reactions that take place in the liver as compared to lungs . it is therefore noted that the prevalence estimates provided here may have some bias as abattoir sample populations is not always representative of the reference populations where animals are drawn . the overall combined prevalence of bovine echinococcosis during the period under review was estimated at 3.0 table 1 which was close to prevalence observed in our prospective study . mukukutu camp in senanga district accounted for the highest prevalence at 4.0 95 ci 3.811.8 while lukulu central camp in lukulu

these reports are inconclusive .", "currently heparin is recommended as the initial drug of choice for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis followed by long term anticoagulation with warfarin51012 . contrast enhanced ct scans demonstrate multiple intraluminal filling defects and nonvisualization of the sinus18 . at many institutions cvc is routinely inserted before undergoing major surgery or treating patients with critical illnesses or cancer . 2c . results of central venous catheter tip and blood culture was reported staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus respectively . we report a case of internal jugular vein sigmoid sinus thrombosis due to a misplaced central venous catheter . in our case culture results of the subclavian catheter tip and blood were confirmed as staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus respectively and we switched from broad spectrum antibiotics to vancomycin . retrospective analysis of the contrast enhanced ct scan and ct angiography showed an empty delta sign and absence of venous flow within the right internal jugular vein sigmoid sinus that was sufficient for diagnosis of sinus thrombosis fig . subclavian or internal jugular vein thrombosis associated with indwelling catheters will propagate into other vessels but extension into the intracranial sinuses and veins is rare . the most frequently available anatomical sites for cvc are the subclavian and internal jugular veins . also the right internal jugular vein and sigmoid sinus were not visualized on ct angiography . three reports describe an association between cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and central venous hyperalimentation due to placement of the catheter tip in the internal jugular vein31516 . the patient s condition worsened leading to thrombosis of the internal jugular vein secondary to sigmoid sinus thrombosis . malpositioning of the catheter tip may happen more often in the subclavian vein than the internal jugular vein . retrospectively we confirmed that contrast enhanced brain ct scans revealed a low density lumen surrounding a sharply enhanced dense vessel wall at the sigmoid sinus on the right side . in patients with a cvc the risk of catheter related infection was reported to range between 1 and 101 . when a cvc causes thrombosis the risk of catheter related sepsis may increase . the risk of thrombosis may increase when hyperosmolar parenteral nutrition fluid is administered through a misplaced central venous catheter into a internal jugular vein315 . also positioning of the catheter tip in the subclavian vein is associated with a high risk of thrombus formation and vessel occlusion2 . postoperative chest x ray was normal except for malposition of the

frequent use for the treatment of osteoporosis osteopenia and other diseases . he died of multiorgan failure . 2b . 4b . many reports indicate that the incidence of onj is significantly higher with the use of intravenous iv bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid zometa novartis basel switzerland than by the use of oral bisphosphonate 3 15 . in our patient the period of oral bisphosphonates use was only 7 weeks but it caused severe symptoms . the incidence of onj because of the use oral bisphosphonates was higher in japan than in europe and america 16 . the period of drug use is also important and longterm use is considered a high risk for the development of onj . the patient was a 59yearold man with a history of smoking and drinking insulin use for diabetes cirrhosis associated with chronic hepatitis c steroid use for interstitial pneumonia sepsis and spinal disk herniation . however he had many systemic factors such as diabetes cirrhosis and steroid use for interstitial pneumonia . bacterial identification and microbial sensitivity test the transition in the laboratory test values for the white blood cell count wbc and the creactive protein crp level and the use of several antibiotics for cellulitis and medicationrelated osteonecrosis of the jaws mronj . physicians have to be careful when administering bisphosphonate other antiresorptive agents and antiangiogenic medications for patients with multiple systemic factors even if the patients seem to have no problems in the oral cavity . his multiple systematic factors and mronj caused lethal sepsis because it fulfilled the diagnostic criteria previous treatment with bisphosphonate exposed bone in the maxillofacial region that has persisted for 8 weeks and no history of radiation therapy to the jaws . in this case we do not know whether the dentures were illfitting and there were denturerelated traumatic ulcers because he already had ulcerations and exposed bone when we first saw him . in this case thus it is thought that there were another option not to use bisphosphonate for such a highrisk patient or at least before administration we had to perform a risk assessment for mronj enough . physicians have to be careful with the use of bisphosphonates or other bone resorption inhibitors in patients regardless of the presence or absence of teeth or surgical history . in this case report the patient developed mronj and died of sepsis although he received shortterm oral bisphosphonate therapy and had not received any dental surgical treatment because he was completely edentulous . the presence of multiple systemic factors can be a very high risk for mronj even though there are few medicationrelated factors and local factors 8 9 10 . bisphosphonate use 2 local factors e.g. physicians who prescribe bisphosphonates or other bone resorption inhibitors have to provide a detailed explanation to patients of the risk of mronj and consult dentists if a patient has even a small risk factor . thus it may be that the development of onj is associated with the inhibition of bone resorption rather than the use of a certain type of drug . to prevent mronj dentists and dental hygienists have to explain sufficiently to patients the importance of oral hygiene and perform oral care and dental treatments before patients use these drugs .", "supported by nci 2p50 ca09825806 ,

suggests that health promotion interventions that result in an increase in healthy lifestyle in the general population might significantly reduce the growing burden of type 2 diabetes . the absolute risk difference between groups increased during the postintervention period intensive lifestyle intervention for a limited time can yield long term benefits on type 2 diabetes risk in individuals with igt . a total of 522 individuals with igt were randomized to either an intensive lifestyle or a control intervention during an average of 3.2 years of follow up type 2 diabetes incidence was reduced by 58 in the lifestyle group . estimated the association between the achievement of the five lifestyle goals used in the dps and the type 2 diabetes risk developing diabetes during a 4.6year follow up 29 . after median follow up of 30 months the relative risk reduction in type 2 diabetes incidence was with lifestyle modification 26.4 with metformin and 28.2 with lifestyle modification and metformin as compared with the control group . the american diabetes association consensus group also recommended lifestyle intervention initially for people with ifg or igt weight control and physical activity but does not mention diet at all . it is also important to realize that the identification of people having a high risk of type 2 diabetes or asymptomatic type 2 diabetes is not identical with the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes . more recently several trials have tested the efficacy of lifestyle intervention in prevention of type 2 diabetes . achieving the physical activity goal of 150 min week reduced diabetes risk especially among those participants who did not achieve the weight reduction goal of 7 with risk reduction of 44 compared with those who achieved neither the weight reduction nor the physical activity goal . after adjustment for other components of the intervention there was a 16 reduction in diabetes risk per 1 kg weight lost during the first year of the intervention . in the early randomized intervention study in malmhus sweden 19 lower rates of type 2 diabetes was found in igt men randomized to dietary intervention compared with those who received no therapy . with compelling evidence that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed strategies to implement the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes both in high risk subjects as well as at the population level are urgently needed . these findings suggest that dietary composition and physical activity are important in diabetes prevention but their effect on diabetes risk is primarily mediated through resulting weight reduction . the results from the randomized controlled trials all show that people with impaired glucose tolerance who received enhanced lifestyle advice had significantly lower on average 50 reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes compared with those allocated to receive usual care . nevertheless because of multicolinearity it should also be noted that in the indian diabetes prevention program 15 and chinese prevention study 14 the participants were relatively lean and there was no large change in body weight but despite that a remarkable reduction in diabetes risk was apparent . thus in these studies components of the intervention other than weight control were responsible for the beneficial effects on diabetes risk . the results of the finnish diabetes prevention study dps provided the first convincing evidence from a proper randomized controlled trial that type 2 diabetes can be prevented by lifestyle modification 21 . however the evidence is not there to show that the combination of lifestyle and metformin is effective on the contrary the results from the indian diabetes prevention program suggest that there is no additional benefit from metformin over and above lifestyle intervention 15 . none of the participants who met all five of the goals 0.8 of the total population developed diabetes whereas the risk of diabetes was highest in those who did not meet any of these goals . in the dps the risk of being diagnosed with diabetes was strongly associated with the number of lifestyle goals achieved 21 . the indian diabetes prevention program 14 recruited 531 people with igt who were randomized into four groups control lifestyle modification metformin and combined lifestyle modification and metformin . the trials listed above have demonstrated the benefits of healthy lifestyle on delaying the deterioration of glucose tolerance to manifest type 2 diabetes at least as long as the intervention continued . the relative risk reduction after 2.8 years was 58 in the lifestyle intervention group compared with the placebo group .", "in the articular fibrous cartilage articular disk any previously described nrec was identified only s100 protein seemed to react with chondrocytes both in normal and diseased tissues . in pathological patients with severe disk damage number and morphology of chondrocytes were severely different in comparison to normal

different morphoology especially after s100 immunostaining they had an elongated cytoplasm with one or more thick dendritiform processes of variable length but with a strong reactivity only for s100 protein . the results of our study indicate that free nervous endings described by other authors 3 8 are definitely proven to be nrec and it appears likely to stress that especially in pathological

surprisingly high levels of activity in vitro toward drugs that are used in dogs such as benzodiazepines . an example of locus snp22 is shown in table 5 in which the snp marker exhibited a significant difference from the control population p 0.0001 . the haplotypes for all individuals were analysed using the snpstat programme which enabled estimation of the haplotype frequencies . according to the

cimarron population 19 in the border collie population 22 in the labrador retriever population and 18 in the german shepherd population . breeds that suffer from a deletion of the mdr1 gene are more likely to experience adverse reactions in response to low doses of the drug . several recent pharmacogenetic findings have been shown to be clinically relevant for patients of veterinary clinics and the dog population is one of the most suitable models for examination of population genetics . this technology can detect animals that might be at risk and verify their genotypic characteristics to personalise drug therapy at the individual level rather than the population level . the rationale was to identify genetic polymorphisms in the genes that encode proteins and enzymes involved in drug transport metabolism and action that can predict the usefulness of a particular drug to increase the numbers of responders and decrease the numbers of subjects affected by adverse drug reactions . these deficiencies have been shown to significantly alter the pharmacokinetic behaviour of two drugs and associated with large inter individual differences in the kinetic behaviour of a third drug . the association analyses of haplotypes are similar to those of genotypes in that logistic regression results are shown as either ors and 95 cis or as linear regression results with differences in means and 95 cis . this is because of the way in which they appear and are distributed in a population . in contrast the uruguayan cimarron breed exhibited less genetic variability and fewer inbreeding characteristics 0.27243 fis value and was also free of inbreeding problems . additionally this gene is constitutively expressed in human and dog livers and involved in the metabolism of many drugs including caffeine phenacetin teophylline and tracing drugs . in each breed 34 of the individuals exhibited haplotype number 1 while 21 exhibited haplotype number 2 and the remaining haplotypes had frequencies below 10 . furthermore the affected breeds have a similar lineage that includes other sheepdog breeds such as old english sheepdogs australian shepherds shelties english

tumor measuring 8 3 cm containing yellow serous fluid .", ". to partly address this concern the patients who completed the cbt program were compared at admission and discharge to hospital with those who did not begin the cbt program on the one hand and those who withdrew from the program on the other . it is possible that the symptom changes that are observed during the cbt program may not be attributable to the program but due to patient selection and other factors associated with hospital care e.g. to examine these issues the changes from admission to pre cbt and then to post cbt in individual honos items what is apparent from figure 1 is that the inpatient stay prior to entry into cbt is associated with small changes in anxiety and depression but substantial improvements in memory orientation activities of daily living self harm aggression and substance problems whereas the cbt program is associated with the greatest changes in emotional symptoms . the difference between inpatients who began the cbt program and those who did not suggests that the cbt program is providing benefits over and above treatment as usual . thus despite the absence of differences at admission those who completed the cbt program were the least depressed at discharge . however while it remains possible that the treatment did not cause the observed outcomes given that cbt has been demonstrated to be an efficacious treatment for depression and the current treatment effects were comparable to those observed in the efficacy studies it is not unreasonable to presume that the application of an empirically validated treatment albeit in a modified form was largely responsible for the observed improvements . of the variables examined there was no difference in bdi scores between patients from pre to post cbt for whom the depression was a single episode or a recurrent episode f1146 2.37 .02 p ns or for whom the depression was judged to be primary or secondary to another disorder f1151 0.15 .001 p ns . since cbt is aimed at changing emotions mood related symptoms should change more during the cbt program than at other points in the inpatient admission . thus while patients may have had exposure to other treatments before or after the cbt program they were not engaged in any other treatment except concurrent psychopharmacotherapy at the time . despite these limitations it appears reasonable to conclude that cbt can be adapted to an inpatient psychiatric clinic and the effectiveness of such a program is comparable to that observed in more homogenous patient samples found in efficacy studies . in conclusion the present study found that an evidence based treatment for depression could be modified to an inpatient treatment setting without substantial loss of effectiveness . the bdi scores improved somewhat from admission m 30.3 to pre cbt m 24.7 f1152 60.76 .29 p .001 markedly from pre to post cbt m 12.2 f1152 299.90 .66 p .001 and remained stable until followup m 12.2 f1152 0.003 .00 p ns . the present study can not identify the extent to which incorporating cbt into an inpatient program can reduce the overall length of hospital stay . the total patient population comprised an archival dataset of 998 consecutive inpatient admissions diagnosed with a major depressive disorder from july 1996 to march 1999 who spent at least one day in hospital and who completed a bdi at admission to hospital . excluding those studies that were not cbt the values improved the estimate of the treatment effect somewhat bdi before treatment of 25.5 to 11.6 at after treatment for clients with a mean age of 36 and a mean number of 20 therapy hours . in terms of the staff rated gaf the scores rose from admission m 49.3 to pre cbt m 56.9 f1120 32.00 .21 p .001 and continued to increase from pre to post cbt m 69.1 f1120 219.65 .65 p .001 . although there was no difference in bdi scores before and after cbt between patients with more secondary medical conditions f6146 1.67 .06 p ns there was a hint that patients with more secondary substance use problems might have worse outcomes f3149 2.44 .05 p .07 . however this is an empirical issue that has already been answered numerous times in controlled efficacy studies and the present question is related to the effectiveness of cbt in a particular context . finally to evaluate the size of the treatment change published treatment data were used to generate benchmark pre and posttreatment data . the average time between admission and initiation of the cbt program was 4.9 days sd 7.4 . the number of patients who demonstrated a clinically significant improvement from pre to post cbt i.e. the intensive program brought about reductions in depression ratings compared to those found in the literature more generally but importantly it was able to achieve these gains within a two week period rather than the more usual 1620 weeks of treatment . the degree to which this clinical observation can be replicated in a controlled study it should be possible to start to isolate the factors that are beneficial about treating heterogenous patient groups . major depressive disorder single episode and recurrent dysthymic disorder depressive disorder not otherwise specified and adjustment disorder with depressed mood outpatients . there were significant differences between the groups across these two time intervals f2602 3.74 .01 p .05 . the present study examined the effectiveness for patients with depression of a cbt program adapted to an inpatient psychiatric clinic . 60.2 of patients demonstrated clinically significant improvement after treatment . first people with depression who require inpatient admissions often do so at a time of crisis or extreme symptom severity and the aim is to quickly and safely return them to levels of independent function . the therapy staff observes that the mixed patient groups rather than being a hindrance are an assistance to therapy since patients can assist one another in helping each other with their different problems . in conducting an evaluation of the current program there were a variety of constraints imposed by the context . their outcomes for the bdi revealed a decline from 26.9 sd 8.9 to 16.5 sd 11.3 . in addition patients completed the locus of control of behaviour scale lcb to assess their sense of control over themselves and their lives . in particular it is also clear that packaging a cbt program as part of an inpatient treatment program can deliver comparable treatment outcomes to spaced treatments but it did not achieve these outcomes at the expense of longevity of treatment gains . while these can not be ruled out attempts were made to examine the degree to which these variables may have affected the data . ideally these patient groups will be similar at admission to hospital but patients who complete the cbt program will have superior outcomes . translating empirically validated treatments into routine clinical practice is an essential activity that requires a multitude of factors to be addressed .", "fifteen percent of patients with rvo suffer from

control cohort and rvo patients with me defined as retinal thickening within 500 m of the macular center and vi defined as best corrected visual acuity 2040 in the rvo eye were accomplished utilizing international classification of disease codes icd9icd10 reviewing patient charts for text entries of symptoms that supported a diagnosis of rvo and concomitant comorbidity and reviewing patient treatment records unique to rvo including consultation notes and hospital discharge summaries . this was the first study to assess the incidence of vi due to me secondary to brvo and crvo and to describe the disease characteristics of patients with rvo in a canadian setting . please refer to table 3 for data on incidence and type of rvo within the rvo cohort . please refer to table 2 for data on disease characteristics for the control and rvo cohorts . consistent with findings in other studies rvo in this patient population was associated with several vascular comorbidities . a few other studies have assessed the incidence of rvo . fifty three patients had brvo and 20 patients had crvo as interpreted from consultation notes . 73 of 47166 patients over 40 years of age with new diagnosis of rvo and a control cohort of 76077 patients were extracted for this analysis . brvo and crvo are easily detected using standard ophthalmological diagnostic tools and techniques so while the diagnosis and classification of rvo are valid difficulties in interpreting data contained in consultation notes as well as data concerning number of episodes requiring consultation and treatment during the observation period may have resulted in some inconsistencies in data capture . one quarter of rvo patients had a history of vascular disease primarily mi and stroke . consistent with previous literature we found that patients with rvo were more likely to present hypertension dyslipidemia or vascular diseases compared with general population 4 1719 . given the close association of rvo with systemic vascular disease new patients with rvo should be evaluated for hypertension diabetes and lipid abnormalities as it may be the presentation of significant vascular morbidity . further our findings concur with previous studies that found risk factors more common in patients with brvo .", "one of the interesting phenomena of dpp4 inhibitor or vildagliptin is that it is blood glucose dependent and does not cause hypoglycemia when given as monotherapy which is again a therapeutic advantage of dpp4 inhibitors vildagliptin during ramadan fasting . a recent review published in switzerland and france has studied worldwide the role of dpp4 inhibitors including vildagliptin during ramadan fasting and has come to the conclusion that the anti diabetic agents dpp4 inhibitors could be a more safer option while managing type2 diabetes during ramadan fasting with a very low risk of hypoglycemia.47 another prospective noninterventional study published in france to assess real life rate of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting in patients with type 2 diabetes and their ongoing dual therapy of metformin vildagliptin or metformin sulfonylurea has shown that hypoglycemia as an

content analysis .", ". . . comparison of damaged dna in different treatment groups of hdfs in the present study showed that total dna damage was significantly increased in senescent cells while less damaged dna was observed in young and presenescent hdfs . damaged dna was higher in senescent hdfs compared to young and presenescent cells p .05 which was decreased with trf treatment p cell cycle progression analysis showed that the cell population in the s phase was lower p .05 in senescent hdfs compared to young hdfs . in contrast cell populations in g0g1 phase decreased significantly p .05 with trf treatment in young presenescent and senescent hdfs figure 6 . decreased level of total dna damage and increased percentage of cells in s phase in trf treated senescent cells indicated a potential protective role of trf against dna strand breaks and cell cycle arrest . quantitative analysis showed the percentage of cells positive for sagal staining was increased p .05 in senescent cells compared to young and presenescent hdfs . treatment with trf significantly increased p .05 cells in the s phase and g2m phase for all stages of cellular senescence of hdfs . however incubation with trf was shown to decrease the percentage of cells positive for sagal suggesting a reversal of cellular ageing of hdfs . telomere length in senescent hdfs was significantly decreased compared to untreated young hdfs p .05 . therefore we concluded that tocotrienol rich fraction delays or prevents cellular ageing particularly in senescent hdfs as shown by the elongated telomere length decreased levels of damaged dna and progression of cell cycle to s phase besides increased cell propagation in all stages of cellular ageing of hdfs with trf treatment . our data in the present study suggested that both telomere shortening and decreased telomerase activity might be the contributing factors in cellular ageing . similarly our data showed significant decreased in s phase cells and increased in damaged dna in senescent hdfs indicating less cell proliferation and greater dna damage as cells aged . treatment with trf significantly increased the telomerase activity in senescent hdfs p .05 whereby no effects was observed in young hdfs figure 7d . our data showed no significant difference in g0g1 or g2m phase with cellular ageing of hdfs while the s phase cells decreased significantly . incubation of senescent cells with 0.5 mg ml trf significantly decreased p .05 the percentage of positive sagal stained cells compared to untreated control figure 4 . senescent cells have been shown to accumulate with age in human tissues and thus have been suggested to contribute to organismal ageing . for presenescent hdfs the percentage of viable cells was significantly increased p .05 with trf incubation at concentrations of 0.3 mg ml 0.4 mg ml and 0.5 mg ml figure 1b while the percentage of viable cells for senescent hdfs was significantly increased p .05 with trf treatment at all concentrations figure 1c . typical morphology of senescent cells observed in this study has also been reported with multiple passages of cells . our results showed that when hdfs reached senescence there were clear changes in cell morphology decreased cell proliferation and increased senescence associated galactosidase activity . a permanent cell cycle arrest occurs with cells remaining in g0g1 phase during senescence . figure 1 shows the percentage of viable fibroblast cells after incubated with trf at various concentrations 0.10.5 mg ml for 24 h. the percentage of viable cells was significantly increased p .05 with trf treatment at 0.5 mg ml figure 1a for young hdfs . oxidative stress caused damage to dna which increased significantly in senescent cells especially in postmitotic tissues and the levels correlated with ageing and age related diseases . our previous study had shown that both tocotrienol and tocopherol protected against oxidative stress induced telomere shortening in hdfs derived from differently aged individuals .  the in vitro ageing of human diploid fibroblasts hdfs first described by hayflick and moorhead has become a classical experimental model to study cellular ageing . ros caused chronic and persistent damage to dna causing double strand breaks that remain unrepaired which tend to accumulate in senescent cells indicating a possible cause of ageing in mammals . it has been clearly demonstrated that cell replication caused telomere shortening due to the inability of dna polymerase to completely replicate the 3ends of lagging strands in the majority of normal human somatic cells which lack telomerase activity . the decreased and increased cells in g0g1 phase and s phase respectively were observed with trf treatment at various stages of cellular ageing indicating inhibition of growth arrest and enhancement of cell replication . cellular senescence in response to dna damage or degradation would make the cells s progeny nonviable and might indicate a decline in renewal capability of cells as they reach an irreversible growth arrest . our data on cells viability study showed trf treatment increased the percentage of viable cells with increasing concentrations of trf . in view of this this study was designed to evaluate the molecular mechanism of tocotrienol rich fraction in possibly modulating different stages of cellular ageing in hdfs by determining the changes in molecular markers of cell ageing sagal dna damage telomere shortening and cell cycle progression in young presenescent and senescent hdfs . the restoration of telomerase activity induced by tocopherol caused significant increased in telomere length especially in skin fibroblast obtained from old donor 26 41 . granular cytoplasmic and vacuoles accumulation are common features of senescent cells accounting for the large cells . previous study reported that vitamin e reduced h2o2induced ho generation and subsequent dna base pair modification in human oral epithelial cells besides decreasing h2o2induced dna strand breaks in human skin cell line vh10 . vitamin e has been shown to reduce h2o2induced oh generation and subsequent dna base pair modification in human oral epithelial cells and h2o2induced dna strand breaks in human skin cell line vh10 . even though beneficial effects of vitamin e have been established in ageing ongoing studies are being done to determine mechanisms involved and actual response of different stages of cellular ageing . figure 7c shows the representative pcr analysis for telomerase activity of hdfs at various passages with trf treatment . significant telomere shortening occurred as a consequence of prolonged h2o2 treatment but not in acute treatment . in the absence of an adequate repair system accumulated dna damage caused mutagenic alterations resulting in cancer ageing and abnormalities in the nervous system . cell viability study was performed using mts assay . in such a situation treatment with trf however protected against telomere shortening in senescent hdfs with concomitant increased in telomerase activity . at least 300 cells per slide were counted and two slides were prepared for each treatment . however with senescence the original fibroblastic shape was lost and hdfs became larger and flattened with accumulation of cytoplasmic granular inclusions figures 2a2c .", "m.c.l . j.c.t . n.g . and d.c.d . 2015 patel et al . 2015 patel et al . in daf2 mutants daf16 protected against pab1 aggregation in aged animals figures 5c and 5d importantly daf2 mutants use daf16 to control different types of age dependent protein aggregation because delayed aggregation of the kinase kin19 was also dependent on daf16 figure 5 g . whereas the majority of pab1 and tiar2 proteins were diffusely localized in non stressed young animals we found that both stress granule components accumulated in distinct puncta in aged animals figures 2b and 2d figure s4f this change was specific for pab1 and tiar2 as the fluorescent tags alone venus or tagrfp remained diffuse with age figure s4e david et al . 2012 2016 walther et al . 2016 david 2012 david et al . because of the small size of the age dependent stress granule like puncta it was not possible to assess the mobility of tiar2 or pab1 in these structures . 2010 demontis and perrimon 2010 walther et al . therefore the overall reduction in widespread protein aggregation in long lived daf2 conditions as evidenced by our proteomic analysis at least in part through increased daf16 activity could be an effective strategy to prevent sgrbp aggregation . 2009 neumann et al . the age dependent aggregation of sgrbps and prevalence of stress granule components in neurodegenerative diseases underline their relevance as therapeutic targets . pab1 and tiar2 are the c. elegans homologs of human polyadenylate binding protein 1 pabp1 and t cell restricted intracellular antigen1 tia1 two prominent rbps that localize to stress granules and are also minor components of pathological inclusions that occur in als and fltd bentmann et al . by omitting sds and using ultracentrifugation at 500000 g walther et al . we speculated that widespread protein misfolding and aggregation occurring with age could promote sgrbp aggregation . therefore it is possible that hsp110 does not modulate stress granule dynamics and sgrbp aggregation in c. elegans . the consequences of age dependent protein aggregation for the animal s health are poorly understood . overall the role of stress granules in neurodegenerative diseases is clearly highly complex because there is evidence supporting the recruitment of disease associated proteins to stress granules and vice versa . 2012 rousakis et al . 2015 2015 murakami et al . 2010 demontis and perrimon 2010 reis rodrigues et al . frap analysis was performed as previously described david et al . in the single transgenics importantly when both pab1 and kin19 were co expressed the presence of misfolded kin19 triggered more abundant pab1 aggregation at an earlier age figure 6c . 2010 . 2010 . 2010 . 2010 . 2010 . 2010 . 2010 . during the aging process both proteins spontaneously assembled into small puncta similar to liquid droplets induced during stress and into larger aggregates . interestingly several rbps with lc prion like domains were identified in the insoluble proteome of aged animals david et al . consistent with the dynamic nature of stress granules these puncta were no longer observed 24 hr after the heat shock figures 2a and 2c . next we examined the role of the transcription factor daf16 activated by reduced daf2 signaling lin et al . to induce longevity we subjected animals to daf2 rnai and control animals to gfp rnai

to our knowledge this is the first report of cataract occurring in cluster headache patients and interestingly on the same eye affected by the pain attack . interestingly most of the cited studies analyzed the cataract prevalence in age groups which are substantially different from those of our two cases . it is of interest that both patients developed cataract in a young age after suffering for years from chronic cluster headache attacks and in the absence of main risk factors for the development of early onset cataract including prolonged steroid drugs exposure . epidemiological data for the general population are scarce only five studies have been carried out until now on cluster headache prevalence in the general population with conflicting results prevalence rates vary between 56 and 326 cases in every 100000 inhabitants . here we report two cases that both developed cataract before the age of 50 years on the side affected from the cluster headache and reviewed published similar cases and potential mechanisms for comorbidity . prevalence studies of age related cataracts are hampered by the absence of a uniform grading system for cataract opacities by differing definitions of visual impairment and by additional coexisting ocular pathologies causing loss of vision .", "2 . an active length of 2.5 cm was used to deliver a fraction dose of 5 gy at 5 mm depth to

disease severity of the tested groups given the strong correlation between tear osmolarity and disease severity.911 the more severe the ded the higher the threshold and the greater the variability in the tear osmolarity value.9 the currently agreed upon value that discriminates between healthy and dry eyes is when the higher tear film osmolarity value of the two eyes is 308 mosm l.510 as with any diagnostic tool interpretation must be based on the complete clinical picture including other diagnostic tests that might be helpful in determining the dry eye etiology.10 certain commonly encountered external factors such as contact lens wear may or may not increase tear osmolarity depending on the individual response.224 the impact of environmental factors such as temperature humidity and airflow on tear osmolarity appears unclear as is the effect of sex hormones these factors would benefit from further investigation.2021253637 the effect of ocular surgery on tear osmolarity may be partially dependent on the patient s age the type of surgery performed and the ability of the eye to recover.2629 systemic conditions commonly believed to result in dry eye such as dehydration diabetes and thyroid ophthalmopathy have been shown to increase tear osmolarity as expected.313235 ocular conditions such as herpetic keratitis pterygia and pseudoexfoliation syndrome have also been demonstrated to increase tear osmolarity.383941 keratoconus largely viewed clinically as a non inflammatory condition was not associated with increased tear osmolarity.40 some pharmaceuticals such as mucin

osmolarity was better at predicting dry eye severity as tear osmolarity increased dry eye severity also increased in a largely linear pattern.811 another study also demonstrated that tear osmolarity had higher sensitivity when compared with corneal staining conjunctival staining and meibomian grading and better specificity when compared with tbut and schirmer s test results.10 the higher the severity of ded the greater the correlation between tear osmolarity and other diagnostic tests8 this result may indicate that other diagnostic tests are less sensitive to mild ded diagnosis . in a recent 2013 article no change in tear osmolarity or any other dry eye diagnostic test was observed after refractive surgery despite a decrease in corneal sensitivity.26 after cataract surgery tear osmolarity has been noted to increase.27 the difference here may be explained by the subjects ages average age was 26 years in the refractive surgery study26 and 71 years in the cataract surgery study.27 older patients may take longer to recover from surgically induced ocular trauma.27 trabeculectomy surgery performed on a patient population with an average age of 71 years also had higher tear osmolarity than a control group this result was attributed to the presence of the bleb the use of mitomycin c which may cause epithelial damage or the residual effects of long term use of glaucoma medications before surgery.28 no difference in tear osmolarity was noted between the eye that underwent eyelid reconstruction surgery and the un operated eye of the same patient this result may be related with corrective tearing as evidenced by the higher schirmer s test results in the operated eye.29 the effect of external factors such as humidity on tear osmolarity is not clear . this study9 concluded that increased tear osmolarity is likely a precursor for dry eye complaints despite the lack of correlation between tear osmolarity and dry eye symptoms . this study9 concluded that

such differences may account for the conflicting results.2021 in addition the use of less sensitive diagnostic tests may have resulted in the inclusion of some mild dry eye patients in the normal group which would have further confounded results . such differences may account for the conflicting results.2021 in addition the use of less sensitive diagnostic tests may have resulted in the

responses to hypoxia and autologous blood donation is not feasible because the hemodilution that ensues may not be tolerated . in another single blind randomized study of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery patients treated with low dose 100 units kg rhuepo for 4 days before surgery received less than half the amount of autologous blood p 0.01 as compared with the control group . patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery who received rhuepo 300 units kg per day for 10 days preoperatively on the day of surgery and 4 days postoperatively had a nearly six fold reduction in allogeneic transfusion risk as compared with patients who received placebo . in patients with a hemoglobin under 8.5 g dl and with colorectal cancer 300 iu kg rhuepo on day 4 before surgery followed by 150 iu kg for the next 7 days thereafter stimulated erythropoiesis and reduced transfusion requirements compared with placebo . in another study of noncardiac surgical patients of various types comprising a large veterans administration database perioperative anemia and blood transfusions were associated with an increased risk for infection higher mortality rates and substantial consumption of health care resources . transfusion requirements were reduced and hemoglobin levels were improved with preoperative rhuepo treatment in patients with gastrointestinal tract cancer and in those with rectal cancer undergoing surgery . in veterans undergoing noncardiac surgery the incidence of preoperative anemia hematocrit 36 was 34 and in surgical patients who refused transfusions because of religious reasons 28 had preoperative hemoglobin levels less than 12 g dl . when surgical blood losses are anticipated to exceed 3000 ml rhuepo is effectively used in conjunction with pad . coronary artery disease patients with anemia exhibit higher mortality rates and experience more cardiac abdominal and renal complications after cardiac or noncardiac surgery than do patients with normal hemoglobin levels . the positive impact of rhuepo is readily apparent in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery which is often elective and associated with substantial blood losses . although it has been documented that patients prefer to receive autologous blood those who are anemic before surgery are not candidates for preoperative autologous donation pad . surgery in cancer patients represents a particular challenge because these patients may suffer severe anemia caused by their cancer or its treatment . in another study that compared rhuepo administered daily 300 units kg per day with rhuepo administered weekly 600 units kg per week for four doses beginning 21 days before surgery transfusion requirements were comparable indicating that the weekly rhuepo regimen also reduces transfusion requirements while improving patient convenience . in patients who were to undergo total hip replacement rhuepo facilitated dose dependent increases in pad amounting to 4.3 units 300 iu kg 3.4 units 150 iu kg and 3.0 units 75 iu kg as compared with 2.1 units with placebo and it minimized reductions in hematocrit associated with repeated phlebotomy

"2 . 1 . the current literature supports the laparoscopic splenectomy as a safe and effective procedure in patients with splenic abscess demonstrating an average length of stay of 14 days . although there is still controversy in the current literature when managing splenic abscesses our recommendation is splenectomy especially in the case of ruptured splenic abscess resulting in hemodynamic instability . to our knowledge there have only been four other reported cases of ruptured splenic abscess causing pneumoperitoneum 3 4 . of the 600 cases of splenic abscess documented in the current literature most have been described as air confined to the left upper quadrant on chest x ray . the patient was subsequently boarded for an exploratory laparotomy with repair of perforated viscus as that is the usual cause of pneumoperitoneum especially under the right hemidiaphragm . the patient was taken to the operating room where a laparoscopic splenectomy was attempted but was quickly converted to laparotomy with splenectomy due to the gross contamination of the abdomen . because the patient s vital signs stabilized after being resuscitated the decision was made to obtain a ct scan to better assess the location of the perforated viscus . the current literature supports a 67100 success rate with percutaneous drainage however tung et al . whether it is better to perform the splenectomy laparoscopically or open is still debatable the important thing is to obtain source control . this is especially true for patients who are immunocompromised or have underlying comorbidities including neoplasia diabetes trauma or history of splenic infarct or embolization . she returned to the clinic on post operative day 14 to receive her splenectomy vaccinations .

treated with definitive radiotherapy radiochemotherapy . on univariate analysis the ttv figures 1 and 2 and the pre radiotherapy hemoglobin level had a statistically significant impact on the overall survival and on the locoregional control of patients treated with definitive radiotherapy radiochemotherapy . for patients treated with postoperative radiotherapy the pre radiotherapy hemoglobin level showed no prognostic significance in our study . our data suggest that the total tumor volume is the predominant prognostic factor in patients with squamous cell cancer of the oro and hypopharynx treated with definitive radiotherapy radiochemotherapy or surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy . one hundred and thirty eight of 162 85 patients treated with definitive radiotherapy received a concomitant boost fractionation regimen and 24 15 were treated with conventional fractionation single fraction dose of 2 gy one fraction a day five fractions a week . in addition to the quantitative

found substantial age related decline in overall cbf values but the pattern of lateralized changes in response to verbal and spatial tasks was identical in young and elderly people . no studies have linked changes in cbf activation to sex differences in agerelated neuroanatomic changes and to performance of memory and emotion tasks . our data on young adults age 1 8 45 years indicate that men show significant decline in several neurocognitivc domains while women evince no decline . in a sample of 241 healthy young adults aged 18 to 45 124 men 117 premenopausal women women had better verbal memory and men performed better on spatial and motor tasks . women perform better on verbal and memory tasks whereas men excel in spatial tasks . some evidence suggests that women show less age associated cognitive decline than men . as can be seen in figure 6 parenchymal volume goes down with age number of words recalled also declines and the parenchymal volume is associated with memory even with age effects partialled out . however we used tasks that are quite resistant to age effects and the results may differ for tasks showing greater age related decline . the study of age effects on regional brain physiology has been quite extensive with considerable agreement that cerebral blood flow cbf shows age related decline even in people screened for cerebrovascular disorders . effects of aging on regional activation in relation to cognitive strategics have not yet been examined with fmri . activation patterns are linked to performance on cognitive tasks requiring verbal spatial attention memory and facial processing . there are fewer data on the effects of aging on regional brain activation in response to task demands . magnetic resonance imaging mri studies of the brain have documented that aging is associated with progressive parenchymal volume decrease and cerebrospinal fluid csf volume increase . for the entire age range gm continues to decline in volume with aging r1840.49 r920.52 and r900.40 for the whole sample males and females respectively all p0.0001 whereas the volume of csf continues to increase with age the corresponding correlations were 0.31 0.45 and 0.29 all p0.0001 . we found about equal rates of age associated reduction in cbf in men and women and this has also been reported in other studies although samples were usually small in the elderly range . with regional brain activation studies a net increase in signal intensity is observed in regions known to be activated by the task . for men however increased age was associated with decrease in performance on attention r0.43 p0.0001 verbal memory r0.20 p0.029 spatial memory r0.34 p0.0001 and spatial abilities r0.33 p0.0002 all df122 all p values are 2tailed figure 3 . when combined with ultrafast echoplanar imaging 100 ms per slice the time course of signal change in response to individual stimuli can thus be observed . while the volume of limbic structures was unrelated to cognitive functions across the age range in older participants reduction predicted declines in explicit memory . the disadvantages of fmri techniques include loud background noise generated by the gradients difficulties in presenting stimuli and performing tasks in the magnet bore claustrophobia low signal to noise for most methods and lack of quantification in physiologic units for most methods . the battery is lengthy and each test provides measures that are difficult to link with current knowledge on brain systems regulating behavior .", "in vitro cultured human airway smooth cells and a549 cells tnf and il1 induce mmp9 expression and cell migration 2 43 44 via various signaling pathways such as pkc mapks nfb and ap1 . nfb controls a wide spectrum of biological effects ranging from immune and stress induced responses to cell fate decisions such as proliferation differentiation tumorigenesis apoptosis and tissue remodeling . thus oxidative stress plays a critical role in inflammatory responses in airway and lung diseases via the upregulation of redox sensitive transcription factors such as ap1 or nfb and thereby proinflammatory genes such as mmp9 vcam1 icam1 cox2 or cpla2 expression . taken together these results show that nfb plays a key role in mediating the expression of inflammatory proteins in airway and lung inflammation and injury figure 2 . moreover various inflammatory signaling pathways including pkcs nadph oxidase ros egfr pdgfr c src pi3k akt mapks ap1 and nfb are involved in the regulation of these inflammatory proteins figure 3 . taken together nadph oxidase ros play a critical role during development of airway and lung diseases figure 2 . moreover we reported that tnf or il1 induces vcam1 and icam1 expression via a c src dependent pathway in human airway smooth muscle cells . increased pkc activity increases nfb dependent proinflammatory cytokine generation in human airway epithelial cells while expression of a dominant negative pkc mutant has inhibiting effects . pkc activity is also increased in proliferating human airway smooth muscle cells . in addition we also found that lta or il1 could induce cpla2 cox2 or mmp9 in human airway smooth muscle cells or a549 cells 3 44 . first superoxide produced by nadph oxidase 2 is required for respiratory burst that occurs in phagocytes leading to microbial killing . it has been shown that lung cells release inflammatory mediators and cytokines chemokines such as il1 il6 il8 and tnf in response to oxidative stress . both acute and chronic events in airway remodeling result from altered expression of multiple genes encoding protein mediators of cell cell signaling ecm remodeling cell cycle control and intracellular signaling pathways . therefore mapks play an important role in mediating airway and lung inflammation figure 2 . a novel cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor bai has been shown to downregulate tnfinduced expression of cell adhesion molecules by inhibition of nfb activation in human pulmonary epithelial cells . systemic inhibition of these kinases using specific small molecule inhibitors for src ptks either pp2 or su6656 significantly attenuated lps induced lung injury and capillary permeability and reduced lps dependent cytokine and chemokine levels in the lung and the serum . moreover the sfks pkc growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors nadph oxidase ros pi3k akt and mapks are components of signaling cascades that respond to extracellular stimuli by targeting transcription factors such as nfb and ap1 resulting in the modulation of inflammatory gene expression . the egfr system on epithelial cells and underlying mesenchymal cells fibroblasts myofibroblasts and smooth muscle cells drives numerous phenotypic changes during the progression of these pulmonary diseases including mesenchymal cell hyperplasia differentiation and ecm production . pkc is increased in the lungs of patients with copd and is thought to be important in the hypertrophy and proliferation of airway smooth muscle cells . inhibition of sfks using specific inhibitors for src ptks either pp2 or su6656 attenuated lps induced lung injury and capillary permeability and reduced lps dependent cytokine and chemokine levels in the lung and the serum . in human lung epithelial cells in addition to activating nfb inducing kinase nik via traf2 tnf could activate c src through pkc . there is evidence for increased expression of c fos in epithelial cells in asthmatic airways and many of the stimuli relevant to asthma that activate nfb will also activate ap1 . bk also induces cox2 protein expression and pge2 accumulation in human airway smooth muscle cells via a pkcdependent signaling . in in vitro studies using macrophages alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells ros have been shown to induce gene expression of inflammatory mediators such as il1 and tnf 57 58 . thus similar processes that govern pmns adhesion to lung airway resident cells may occur and contribute to the damage to these cells seen in inflammatory responses of asthma . increased production of ros has been demonstrated by many cell types within the lung in asthma including macrophages antigen presenting cells apcs neutrophils and eosinophils . recently phagocytic nadph oxidase ros signaling has been shown to play a critical role in promoting tnfinduced nfb dependent acute inflammatory responses and tissue injury specifically in the lungs which is effected by preferential leukocyte infiltration . resident airway epithelial cells produce proinflammatory mediators under the regulation of pkc . in the airway these external signals produce acute responses that modify smooth muscle contraction and may also induce chronic responses that modify airway structure . moreover inflammatory airway and lung diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd are characterized by chronic inflammation . accumulation of inflammatory cells within the airways can be influenced by expression of adhesion molecules on airway epithelium . thus pi3k family plays a prominent role in various airway and lung inflammation figure 2 . class ii pi3ks comprised and isoforms which are characterized by the presence of a c2 domain at the c terminus . there is an increasing evidence that inflammatory proteins such as vcam1 icam1 cpla2 cox2 and mmp9 are involved in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases such as asthma and copd figure 3 . inflammatory airway and lung diseases are characterized by chronic inflammation and oxidant antioxidant imbalance a major cause of cell damage injury . in addition c src has been shown to regulate cox2pge2il6dependent airway inflammation via nadph oxidase ros . taken together these studies indicated that pkcs play a critical role in mediating inflammation and respiratory diseases figure 2 . in addition a recent study also indicated that in acute and chronic animal models of asthma sp600125 a jnk inhibitor reduces bal accumulation of eosinophils and lymphocytes cytokine release serum ige production and smooth muscle proliferation after repeated allergen exposure . cox metabolites have diverse effects in the lung and are known to modify airway tone as well as inflammatory responses . previous study demonstrated that nfb activation occurred rapidly in the ovalbumin ova model of allergic airways disease and that nfb activation predominantly occurred in the epithelial cells of the conducting airways in association with enhanced mrna expression of nfb regulated chemokine genes including mip2 and eotaxin . exogenous h2o2 also activated nfb in a murine model of ros induced acute lung injury . taken together these studies suggest that growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors may also play a key role in mediating expression of inflammatory genes figure 2 . thus this review will focus on some general aspects of inflammatory signaling regulation and summarize current knowledge regarding the presence and functional roles of these inflammatory signal molecules within the respiratory system and their proposed involvement in the expression inflammatory target proteins in response to proinflammatory mediators during airway and lung inflammation . mmps are proteolytic enzymes that are able to degrade extracellular matrix ecm components and thus play a role in cell migration and tissue remodeling . in human airway smooth muscle cells pkc i and are found in the cytosol and ii in the membrane under basal conditions . thus ap1 may play a critical role in mediating expression of various inflammatory proteins . in addition other studies also showed that ly294002 and wortmannin attenuated eosinophilic airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in a murine asthma model . although the use of inhibitors of inflammatory signaling pathways in the treatment of respiratory diseases seems very attractive further studies are needed to identify the exact role of inflammatory signaling molecules in these diseases and to develop highly specific inhibitors . pkcs are important in many cellular responses in the lung including permeability contraction migration hypertrophy proliferation apoptosis and secretion . in a mouse model of chronic lung inflammation allergic inflammation significant inhibition of tnf il4 il13 and rantes regulated on activation normal t cell expressed and secreted in lung homogenates was observed with jnk inhibitor sp600125 . cox2 gene expression can be induced by multiple cytokines and growth factors via activation of transcriptional regulatory proteins that act on these promoter sites . oxidative stress is a deleterious process that leads to airway and lung damage and consequently to several respiratory inflammatory diseases injuries . multiple studies have also reported that stimulation of airway epithelial cells by lps induces the secretion of il8 via a cellular cascade involving a tlr4myeloid differentiation primary response gene myd88nfb dependent pathway . indicated that resveratrol inhibits the activation of nfb p65 by tnf or pma and reduces atp induced mucin secretion from cultured primary rat tracheal surface epithelial rtse cells .", "the cysts may be present in any portion of the nephron or tubule but they are most commonly found in bowman s space and the angle of the loop of henle . although it is unclear whether the development of multiple gastric carcinomas is directly associated with the pathogenesis of cysts in the liver mesenterium and kidney the present case demonstrates that gastric carcinoma can be an external complication in patients with polycystic disease . this is the first case report of multiple gastric carcinomas associated with potter type iii cystic disease of the liver mesenterium and kidney . although it is unclear whether the development of multiple gastric carcinomas is directly associated with the pathogenesis of multiple cysts in the liver mesenterium and kidney this case provides a perspective for etiology of gastric carcinoma with polycystic disease . in 1964 there have been some reports till date that describe the association of malignant neoplasms with potter type iii cystic disease of the liver and kidney 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 however most of these describe pancreatic and hepatobiliary neoplasms arising in patients with polycystic liver and kidney diseases including adpkd and no report has described the association of gastric carcinoma with potter type iii cystic disease of the liver and kidney . polycystic liver disease is a condition characterized by the presence of multiple cysts in the liver which may be inherited or sporadic and most cases of adult polycystic liver disease apld are related to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease adpkd . in the present case computed tomography and ultrasonography scans showed multiple renal and hepatic cysts in addition to multiple cysts in the mesenterium . in the present case although a detailed family history could not be obtained multiple cysts were observed in the liver both kidneys and mesenterium . in these instances a family history however may be absent in 2040 of new patients in whom the diagnosis of adpkd first is suspected from imaging studies which can be due to a de novo mutation of pkd1 or pkd2 genes . therefore according to hatfield and pfister s criteria we considered that this case of association of apld with multiple renal cysts could be classified as potter type iii cystic disease .", "the patient was

overall contact lens performance for symptomatic contact lens wearers . the use of sh drop helps to reduce almost by half the number of subjects experiencing blurry vision during their contact lens wear . subjects with induced ocular dryness by contact lens wear usually tend to drop out from this modality when the benefits of the lenses are outweighed by the discomfort they feel especially during the last hours of wear day after day . for half of the subjects they were told to wear the lens for a month on a daily wear basis and to not use any drops prior to insertion of the lenses . it is easy to realize the impact on wearers practitioners and the contact lens industry if with just one easy additional step before lens insertion it is possible to keep 10 more of the wearers in contact lenses on an ongoing basis and to improve symptoms of others by 50 to 60 . because of that it is possible to say that the use of sh based drops blink contacts before insertion addresses the two major reasons why contact lens wearers drop out from the market . in other words 10 of the subjects experiencing eye soreness and irritation became asymptomatic with the use of a comfort drop on the lens before insertion . a sodium hyaluronate drop before insertion of contact lenses improves the overall comfort but its clinical effect is highly significant at the end of the wearing period during the evening . even subjects using a hydrogen peroxide system found a positive effect from the use of sh drop before lens insertion . in fact it is believed that the use of this product instilled in the lens before insertion would chemically neutralize the biocide effects on the ocular surface helping to alleviate initial and long term discomfort associated to contact lens wear . it consists of 36 questions specific to symptoms of ocular dryness related to contact lens wear . in general it is believed that more than 50 of contact lens wearers are symptomatic of dry eye . clinical findings observed through slit lamp were also improved with the use of sh drops on the lens before insertion . consequently we can say that the use of sh drops before insertion helps to address the two major reasons why patients cease to wear contact lens wear discomfort and vision and contributes to a reduction in the physiological impact from contact lens wear . the first questionnaire used in this study is the contact lens dry eye questionnaire cldeq . this study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcome from the instillation of sh drop as an additional step in the wearing regimen of contact lens wearers on contact lens related comfort and visual performance over the day . we have to consider that blurry vision represents the number 2 reason and the first one for astigmatic patients to drop out from contact lens wear . this is a 50 reduction of symptomatic patients with the use of a sh based drop on the lens before insertion . for the next month the subjects that did not use sh were asked to put a drop of a sodium hyaluronate sh based product blink contacts amo abbott irvine ca on the lens before insertion . its use helps to eliminate or to significantly reduce discomfort symptoms related to contact lens wear and to improve contact lens experience . brennan and efron found that 75 of low oxygen permeable lens wearers report a feeling of discomfort at the end of the day related to dry eye . practitioners therefore should not hesitate to recommend this step to their symptomatic wearers in order to improve their overall contact lens experience . the results provided with and without the use of sh drops were considered for comparison . on insertion the lens balances out with the surrounding ocular environment and the biocides absorbed by the lens matrix are released into the eye possibly contributing to a temporary alteration of the ocular surface especially during the first four hours of wear . found that ocular dryness affects 20 of wearers of new generation silicone hydrogel contact lenses as well as 24 of wearers of older generation low oxygen permeable phema lenses . looking at the intensity of this symptom table 4 a greater difference is found at the beginning of the day after 2 hours of wear p 0.00 . ocular discomfort and ocular dryness were respectively the number one and two reasons identified by subjects to explain this need to withdraw their lenses . a single drop put on the lens before insertion can considerably change the contact lens experience for subjects who report ocular dryness . questions of this questionnaire are related to the subjective evaluation of comfort with the lenses on at different times of the day morning afternoon evening . even if the symptoms remain symptom severity is greatly reduced with the use of sh drops cldeq q5 . another important aspect of this study is that the positive outcome from the use of sh drops before insertion was verified with multiple types of care systems habitually recommended to wearers . for the other half they were told to instill a sodium hyaluronate based comfort drop blink contacts abbott amo irvine ca in the lens not in the eye before insertion . more than 60 of wearers reported remaining comfortable in their lenses during the evening compared with 50 when they did not use the sh drop before insertion comfort questionnaire . at v1 21 of the subjects admit removing their lenses many times week because of discomfort while only 11 report the same at v2 . overall there is a marked difference in the reduction of the severity of eye dryness felt by the patient q5b chi square f461 9.538 p 0.0008 r 0.1847 after 2 hours of wear q5c f261 2.8366 p 005 r 0.1439 and at the end of the wearing time q5d f461 11.6696 p 0.00 r 0.1999 . this ocular sign was markedly reduced with the use of sh drop before insertion of the lens . more subjects 41 versus 38 showed no staining with the use of drops . from this questionnaire we kept for analysis each symptom that was reported by at least 10 of the subjects at one visit intensity of the symptoms was analyzed subquestions . clinically while many benefits 14 15 are recognized studies have shown that silicone hydrogel lenses have not altered end of day discomfort as described above at least not as expected with the exception of senofilcon a which was found to improve comfort in adverse and challenging environments . the results of the present study prove that sodium hyaluronate based drops can be added to the list of products that can help symptomatic contact lens wearers to reduce their overall discomfort cldeq q4 but especially at the end of the day q4 subquestions when it matters most . questions 6 b c and d provide more details on this issue by asking how noticeable the blurry vision was at different times after 2 hours q6b in the middle of the day q6c and at the end of the wearing period q6d . this is the main reason why 20 of low oxygen permeable lens wearers and 13 of silicone hydrogel lens wearers stop wearing contact lenses every year . at the end of the day 15 more patients report no symptom with the use of sh drop v2 f461 5.4858 p 0.03 even after many hours of wear . on many of these aspects care products were also considered as triggering ocular dryness symptoms because they are chemical products that are known to cause short and medium term toxic and allergic reactions leading to patient discomfort . it is a well accepted and easy way to improve contact lens wear . on average a total of 76 22.00 hours of wear week was estimated at v1 which is slightly less than 81 29.50 hours week for v2 . this study aims to evaluate the performance of sodium hyaluronate sh in the same way . on the other hand when we paired results for the same individual subject compared to himself from v1 to v2 there was an increase in the tbut value that is considered statistically significant tukey kramer q 19801 p 005 od and q 19765 p 005 os . this has been proven to contribute to increased patient comfort even at the end of the day . over 60 of subjects reported a very comfortable comfortable lens during the evening after more than 10 hours of wear compared with 52 without the use of the drops . silicone hydrogel lenses are currently considered to be the material of choice compared with hydrogels . table 9 shows the results . table 3 shows the results . conjunctival staining grade 1 was noticed in both temporal and nasal quadrants for 24 of the subjects on visit 1 and 17 on visit 2 . polyhexanides are polycationic agents with a relatively high molecular weight which in theory should limit their absorption by the contact lens . subjects were seen a month later for the final visit and the same clinical procedures were repeated . this difference is not considered statistically significant od p 02372 os p 01598 .", "we are grateful for financial support from the industrial source technology development program of the ministry of

separate samples one disrupting the coding sequence and the other lying 5 to the gene . third cntnap2 which encodes a member of the neurexin family that resides in the juxtaparanodal region of myelinated neurons shows evidence for common allele association with asds as well as an increased burden of rare protein coding mutations and large de novo deletions . however hemizygosity of the cntnap2 gene which encodes a member of the neurexin family contactin associated protein like 2 caspr2 has been reported in schizophrenia and also in individuals with mental retardation . whole genome studies of many thousands of affected individuals are uncovering evidence for genetic overlap between autism schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . we have based this conclusion on the fact that several rare cnvs including deletions of nrxn1 are associated with mental retardation autism and schizophrenia and on the overlap in common risk alleles seen between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 11 13 . studies of cnvs and other rare alleles have found overlap between autism and schizophrenia whereas those of common snp variants have shown overlap between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . over the past few years genetic studies of asds have consistently identified rare and de novo point mutations and large structural variants present in genes encoding interacting synaptic proteins . these studies have also provided strong evidence for genetic overlap between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . the evidence implicating synaptic cell adhesion molecules and their related proteins in asds is strong . genome wide analyses have also implicated further related and interacting synaptic protein coding genes in the etiology of asds . in contrast there is evidence that the global burden of duplications or deletions in bipolar disorder is substantially less than for schizophrenia and asds . psychiatric disorders such as autism schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are therefore effectively groups of symptoms making up syndromes that define groups of patients who show broadly similar outcomes and who respond similarly to treatment . the evidence for involvement of neurexins nrxn1 neuroligins nlgn4 and related proteins such as shanks shank3 mint2 a2bp1 and caspr2 cntnap2 in asds is substantial and growing . although the available data provide relatively strong evidence that disruption of the neurexin1 locus nrxn1 is a risk factor for schizophrenia and asds evidence in relation to bipolar disorder is lacking . deletions of neurexin result in increased lethality normal synapse number and gross anatomy but severely impaired synaptic functioning a pattern strikingly similar to neuroligin gene knockouts . such studies have reported co segregation of putative high risk alleles such as deletions or point mutations with asds or performed so called burden analysis in which different alleles of a particular gene are aggregated and the frequency in cases compared with that in controls . the findings also support the view that schizophrenia has a stronger neurodevelopmental component than bipolar disorder and suggest that it lies on a gradient of decreasing neurodevelopmental impairment between syndromes such as mental retardation and autism on one hand and bipolar disorder on the other . however multiple neurexin gene knockout studies in mice seem to contradict this and suggest that the neurexin neuroligin complex is not essential for synapse formation but for synapse function . so far there have been no systematic comparisons of gwas data for asds with those from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder . neurexins can be divided into two groups and neurexins both are encoded by three genes .", "an accurate determination of the absence of fever

caregivers have perceived phobia associated with their child s fever for reasons that include serious infection seizure brain damage and death.2 paediatricians have regularly advised parents to seek immediate medical attention if their children developed a fever because fever is of great diagnostic importance especially in developing countries where infectious diseases such as malaria and pneumonia are very prevalent.3 in developing countries because of the relatively low level of literacy and financial constraint of procuring reliable thermometers many parents rely on palpation to assess if their children have fever.4 the objective use of the thermometer to detect the presence of fever is often limited to health care settings in most resource poor settings . thereafter each

development of potent anticancer agents . these results demonstrate the effectiveness of using targeted alkylating agents to selectively suppress prostate cancer tumor growth . importantly cytotoxic effects of conjugates 6 and 7 were not observed in cell lines that do not express ar pc3 and hek293 cells establishing that conjugates selectively target ar . conjugation of a targeting moiety to metallo based cytotoxic agents could potentially circumvent nonspecific interactions by selectivity targeting cells that overexpress particular proteins establishing a delivery vector to localize the effects of new therapeutic agents . the ligand binding domain lbd contains ligand dependent activation function 2 af2 forms the ligand binding pocket and mediates interactions between the ar and heat shock proteins figure 1b . conjugate 6 did not promote ar nuclear localization or coactivator binding and inhibited dna binding . there is a growing appreciation for the design of potent and selective therapeutic agents targeting the ar for prostate cancer patients . initial evaluation of the cytotoxic effects for the two most promising metallo based bifunctional agents in cell lines that express ar t47d cells revealed promising biological activity for a cis conjugate ic50 15.9 m but not the trans conjugate ic50 63 m suggesting that the geometry of the platinumii complexes plays a critical role . in many cases it will be necessary to evaluate critical parameters such as selectivity in vivo potency and binding affinity . upon administration of conjugates 6 and 7 to hek293 cells transfected with an ar fluorescent fusion protein conjugate 6 did not promote ar nuclear localization while conjugate 7 did suggesting competitive and noncompetitive mechanisms of action respectively . more importantly progression of prostate cancer has been linked to elevated expression of ar in malignant tissue suggesting that ar plays a central role in prostate cancer cell biology . importantly

disruption of nuclear localization interruption of dna binding and interference with coactivator recruitment . the crystal structure of the ar lbd bound to native ligand dht reveals the amino acid residues critical for maintaining high binding affinity figure 1c . additionally drug resistance has been proposed to arise from constitutively active ar splice variants lacking the ar ligand binding domain . the development of noncompetitive modulators that do not compete against dht for ligand binding could circumvent drug resistance in ar pharmacology . more importantly heterobifunctional displays will likely be designed to target two distinct binding sites on ar enhancing potency and establishing new modes of ar antagonism . current mechanisms proposed for advancement to crpc include the following1alterations in ar co regulatory protein balance2somatic gain of function mutations within ar with the majority in the lbd resulting in activation by other steroid hormones and anti androgens3generation of new fusion gene products4ar ligand independent activation via cross talk with other signaling pathways.these mechanisms have garnered significant attention because of their ability to reactivate ar and disease progression and provide a conceptual underpinning to guide development of new therapeutic interventions . fluorescence polarization assays were conducted to determine if the conjugates compete against dht for binding to the ar ligand binding domain . one targeting moiety optimized for competitive binding at the ligand binding domain and the other for binding to an additional hydrophobic pocket such as af2 or bf3 . a critical objective from a molecular design approach is the ability to induce different er conformations that are dependent upon ligand binding . in contrast continuing interest in anti androgen drug development has led to the fda approval of enzalutamide which targets the ar ligand binding domain for the treatment of crpc figure 3a . the ar consists of four basic elements n terminal domain dna binding domain hinge region and the ligand binding domain lbd . the first domain is the 559 amino acid long intrinsically disordered n terminal domain which contains the ligand independent activation function 1 af1 . in an effort to block dna repair enzymes the essigmann group has developed heterobifunctional dna damaging agents to specifically target prostate cancer cells figure 7 . intriguingly conjugate 6 and 7 share extensive chemical similarities indicating that the disposition of the ligand presentation on the scaffolds can exert a significant influence on the mechanism of action . there is a critical need to develop potent and selective therapeutic agents capable of targeting malignant tissue without compromising normal cell viability . utilizing peptoids as a versatile chemical platform the kirshenbaum lab designed multivalent ethisterone conjugates to specifically target the ar ldb and modulate ar activity via different mechanisms of action . an open question is whether structure based design can be utilized to generate heterobifunctional conjugates that target two distinct binding sites on ar i.e. as discussed above the conformation induced upon agonist or antagonist ligand binding to er figure 10 plays a critical role in the biological outcome . administration of the alkylating agent at a concentration of 10 m induced apoptosis as determined by flow cytometry and cleavage of poly adp ribose polymerase parp in western blot analysis . this strategy results in the blockade of dna repair enzymes in prostate cancer cells that overexpress ar subsequently leading to the disruption of ar mediated transcription and signaling . the anti androgen conjugate successfully delivered the doxorubicin formaldehyde schiff base to cells overexpressing ar highlighting the ability of this approach to enhance selectivity by releasing the pharmacophore in prostate cancer cells . generation of peptidomimetic conjugates capable of antagonizing ar via distinct mechanisms of action could circumvent drug resistance in ar pharmacology . ar coactivator recruitment assays revealed that conjugate 6 did not promote binding between ar and coactivator proteins while conjugate 7 partially recruited coactivator proteins . upon translocation into the nucleus ar binds to palindromic

and a cyclic divalent conjugate 7 did not compete for ar binding . demonstration that coadministration of a competitive ligand such as dht abrogates the activity of the metallo conjugate would further support the hypothesis that targeting is mediated specifically through binding to ar . more recently a derivative of protac5 dubbed protac aa figure 4b was administered to an ar expressing prostate cancer cell line lncap to evaluate effects on cell proliferation . using high resolution structural information the first steroidal constructs aimed toward targeting the er dimer initial studies focused on developing a correlation between linker length and binding affinity . unfortunately most patients receiving anti androgen therapy eventually develop drug resistance as indicated by rising levels of serum prostate specific antigen psa a gene regulated by ar leading to the lethal disease state termed castration resistant prostate cancer or crpc . recent studies from the hannon group have discovered the first metallo based chemotherapeutic conjugates to target ar . although widely used in the clinic these agents are generally nonspecific and exhibit shortcomings that include severe side effects resulting from compromised normal cell viability and drug resistance . the work outlined above suggests that metallo based conjugates can be crafted to exert toxic effects preferentially on cell types that overexpress ar . ar have been identified via chemical screening efforts and include compounds that act on the af2 figure 3b or bf3 site figure 3c on ar to regulate its activity . the bf3 site is a hydrophobic binding pocket located adjacent to af2 on the surface of ar that can allosterically regulate binding interactions between ar and coactivator proteins . ultimately similar strategies could potentially be elaborated for targeting additional metallo conjugates to a range of malignant cell types while mitigating cytotoxic effects on other tissues . importantly the presence of the targeting moiety in the cis conjugate relative to control compounds lacking steroid moieties led to significant structural effects on dna . the ar is an important drug target for treatment of prostate cancer and has been the subject of research for several decades . crystal structure of the er ligand binding domain gray ribbon pdb code 1ere is bound to native ligand estradiol red spheres .

binding to the er ligand binding domain induces a conformational rearrangement that promotes dimerization as determined by site specific mutational analysis . the authors concluded that bivalent conjugates incorporating a 35 linker were most suitable for enhancing er binding affinity . importantly most antagonistic nonsteroidal bivalent conjugates were more potent at inhibiting cell

"the studies showing efa deficiency in phrynoderma patients used alkaline isomerization ai method for estimation of fatty acid levels . however with the available literature and our findings it can be hypothesized that phrynoderma may be a multifactorial disease involving multiple nutrients local factors like pressure and friction and environmental factors manifesting in the setting of increased nutritional demand . the incidence of phrynoderma is higher in the cooler months of the year as is documented in the present study . the absence of the disease in siblings who are also taking the same diet suggests the role of other factors in the manifestation of phrynoderma . although the occurrence of phrynoderma has been related to nutritional status of the patient in the present study the signs and symptoms of nutritional deficiency the ocular manifestations of vit a deficiency in patients with phrynoderma have been reported to be 5 . these investigations were not done because of their non availability in a resource poor set up . normal serum levels of nutrients vit a vit b complex efa have been reported in phrynoderma patients . none of the patients in the present study presented with nutritional deficiency signs of efa vit e and vit c or protein calorie malnutrition . the serum levels of linoleic acid and vit e also increased significantly during the combination therapy . in phrynoderma patients the levels of linoleic acid and phospholipids sensitive indicators of efa deficiency and ratio of linoleic to arachidonic acid indicator of efficient conversion of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid were also normal in phrynoderma patients . the combination therapy of vit b complex and efa or vit b complex and vit e have shown better results when compared to single drug therapy . the proportion of phrynoderma cases in the present study is less compared to other studies where it was found to be 1.3 3 and 5 . most of the studies on phrynoderma were conducted in the early and middle of the last century . therefore clinical features of phrynoderma and its association with nutritional deficiency signs were studied to elucidate the relationship between phrynoderma and nutritional status of patients . in the present study thus increased nutritional demand during childhood and lactation and the lack of good nutrition due to low socioeconomic status may be responsible for occurrence of phrynoderma in these patients . the patients presenting with signs of vit b complex deficiency were less in number when compared to other studies 47.6 50 65 92 and 25 . further prospective case control studies investigating the levels of vit b complex vit a vit e and efa in the blood and skin and also in relation to the treatment are required to delineate the exact

their priorities concerning health and what they feel would most benefit their quality of life and wellness is necessary . physicians felt treatment for obesity was ineffective held negative views of obese patients appearance and compliance attributed obesity causation to lifestyle factors and sought greater compensation in delivering obesity treatment . normal weight physicians were also more likely to feel confident administering said advice to feel physicians were responsible for serving as normal weight role models and to doubt patients would trust weight related advice from overweight

based on results from combined previous observational studies randomized clinical trials and a meta analysis with the following steps 1 estimation of a the survival function of hf hd patients from the membrane permeability outcome study16 dataset and b estimation of the survival function of hdf patients using the risk reduction estimates due to the treatment effect from the meta analysis of mostovaya et al17 even though it includes also studies comparing hdf to low flux hd it was considered the best proxy with respect to other alternative meta analyses available in the literature 2 simulation of the survival of the same sample of patients as if allocated to hf hd or hdf using three state markov models 3 application of state specific hrqol coefficients and differential costs materials testing and consumption of water derived from the literature . in particular the hrqol coefficients linked to age were selected for the model because otherwise a fundamental component of the benefit measurement would have been neglected . several studies suggest that hdf may lead to better clinical results than high flux hd hf hd.23 according to a recent survey hdf was started to prevent dialysis complications increase the efficiency of dialysis for uremic accumulates treat dialysis related hypotension and dialysis related amyloidosis and for intractable pruritus restless leg syndrome and arthralgia not related to dialysis related amyloidosis.4 however to date randomized studies have not conclusively supported the superiority of hdf regarding clinical outcomes.57 in addition concerns have been raised about its cost utility8 leading investigators to conduct cost analyses to assess the differential expenditures between the two therapies.9 in a recent editorial vanholder et al concluded that more expensive therapies should be reimbursed only when evidence of their cost utility defined as the ratio of treatment cost to treatment outcome taking into consideration also the quality of life qol is sufficiently robust.10 the cost of hdf per se has decreased in recent years due to 1 increased market penetration and the subsequent economy of scale in the production of equipment and disposables 2 the pressure on health care costs due to the economic crises prevailing since 2008 and 3 the safety and reliability of online method that have reduced demand for microbiological testing and monitoring.1112 furthermore after the publication of the study of canaud et al2 hdf treatment effectiveness has increasingly been understood to be positively associated with the magnitude of the convection volume used resulting in trends toward the application of higher hdf convection volumes than were applied in earlier cost analyses . given the commonly accepted threshold of 40000qaly this study demonstrated that compared to hf hd hdf is a cost effective treatment for patients on dialysis . the probabilities defining the transition of patients between each of these states were calculated from the previously estimated hazard functions and were specified over a defined time frame cycle . in this study as there are no other data about qol differences between hdf and hf hd in the literature these coefficients have been used in our simulation . consequently the quality and quantity of information available can be reflected in the probability distributions assigned to each input parameter in the model.20 several monte carlo simulations were performed also for patients with different risk profiles by age patients aged 40 50 and 60 years sex and diabetic status.2122 for the sake of simplicity the cohort of simulated 50year old male patients were selected as the reference population for the analysis . these results are quite different from those reported by mazairac et al8 in their cost utility analysis of hdf versus conventional low flux hd based on the unadjusted results for convective volume of the convective transport study contrast.7 their estimated incremental cost per quality adjusted life year of hdf compared to low flux hd was 287679 and certainly not below 140000 under the most favorable assumptions eg applying a convection volume 20.3 l . the aim of this study is to assess the cost effectiveness of hdf compared to hd by a simulation using existing study data . the characteristics of this cohort are coherent with the results from the edta registry reported by van de luijtgaarden et al23 in the last 20 years indeed the mean age of patients who started with hd treatment was 5560 years and on average 60 of patients were male . the icer estimates show a good value for money but some doubts about the cost effectiveness of hdf over hf hd remain due to the residual 20 probability of costs being higher andor benefits being lower with hdf . to a maximum value of 4.86 730 p.a . this message is reinforced in figure 4 which shows that a given threshold value is associated to a higher probability of hdf being cost effective for the 40 and 50year old patients than for the 60year old ones . the effect of using overall hrqol coefficients rather than the hrqol coefficients linked to patient age on the cohort of 50year old male patients is shown in figure 5 . of note the magnitude of the difference between the two studies may be related to the different comparison groups which is low flux hd in the contrast study and hf hd in our model . the results of the 1000 monte carlo simulations for the cohort of 50year old male patients are shown in the cost effectiveness scatter plot in figure 2 . additionally the lack of qol coefficients related to hf hd forced the use of data from a comparison of hdf with low flux hd.8 uncertainty around results is high but this is typical in this kind of analyses neglecting some available evidence only because of its uncertainty would contrast with the comprehensive nature of an economic model . few studies addressed the qol evaluation and none provided hrqol coefficients for the specific comparison of hf hd and hdf fundamental for the purpose of this analysis . contradicting results have been reported on the difference in qol related to hf hd and hdf . this study contributes also to show the scarcity and heterogeneity of data available in the literature that jeopardize the economic evaluation of hdf when compared to hf hd . diabetic patients follow a different survival function and are subject to a different treatment effects of the alternative therapy compared to nondiabetic patients . the same analyses were carried out for the subgroups of 40 50 and 60year old male and female patients table 1 hdf appears to be more cost effective for younger patients . nevertheless the comparison between a cohort of 50year old diabetic male patients and a cohort of 50year old nondiabetic male patients did not reveal significant differences figure 7 . three possible states were considered alive and under therapy dead due to the disease under therapy and dead for other cause ie considering the overall mortality based on age and sex adjusted life tables . of note this meta analysis includes also the contrast study and our cost effectiveness analysis does include all the relevant randomized clinical trials . this was the rationale for conducting a value based study incorporating hrqol as a main outcome of hdf versus hf hd . previously cost inputs were point estimates whereas now costs vary over the range assessed by lebourg et al.12 the ceac for the subgroup of 50year old male patients shows that 21.5 of the simulations are cost saving figure 6 . in the prospective observational study by oates et al9 some patients on hf hd were switched to hdf and others remained on hf hd . either way the variability in the results due to different characteristics of the patients does not affect the conclusions about the cost effectiveness of hdf .", "2011 . 2011 . 2011 . 2011 . 2011 mckhann et al . 2011 and mci due to ad albert et al . 2011

that regulates autophagy in response to er stress is the death associated protein kinase 1 dapk . cannabinoids activate therefore a cell death promoting signalling route that involves the stimulation of er stress autophagy and apoptosis in cancer cells . by contrast induction of er stress in cancer cells may promote the stimulation of autophagy mediated cell death or the activation of a protective autophagy that may contribute to the resistance to certain antitumoral therapies . moreover if autophagy activated following er stress is a survival response restoring er homeostasis e.g. the unfolded protein response in mammalian cells is governed by three transmembrane er stress sensors namely perk pkr like er kinase ire1 inositol requiring enzyme 1 and atf6 activating transcription factor 6 which are kept in an inactive state by binding to the er chaperone bip preventing their oligomerization induced activation . as discussed for the case of er stress autophagy is currently considered a cell survival mechanism that under certain cellular settings can also promote cell death . different stimuli including er stress modulate the interaction between beclin1 and bcl2 family members see also the following sections which is considered an important mechanism of autophagy regulation . in these experiments a dominant negative form of perk or genetic substitution of serine 51 of eif2 by ala which prevents the phosphorylation of this protein prevented polyq protein induced autophagy strongly suggesting that perk dependent eif2 phosphorylation plays an important role in the activation of autophagy in response to the accumulation of unfolded proteins . our recent findings have unravelled that cannabinoids induce autophagy in different types of tumor cells including glioma astrocytoma and pancreatic cancer cells whereas they do not activate this cellular process in nontransformed cells which are resistant to the cell death promoting activity of cannabinoids . as discussed below a variety of stress signals such as nutrient starvation or treatment with different anticancer agents including those that induce er stress stimulate the autophagy process which is nowadays considered as an essential cellular process participating in a number of physiological functions within the cell . whether this pathway has any role in normal cells expressing both mitochondrial and er bax bak still needs to be proven however it can already be argued that jnk functions as a master regulator of both apoptosis and perhaps autophagy pathways after er stress . the proapoptotic multidomain proteins bax and bak can form a protein complex with the cytosolic domain of ire1 and this interaction has been shown to be essential for ire1 signaling . activation of dapk upon er stress relies on the dephosphorylation of an inhibitory autophosphorylation site of the kinase by a pp2a phosphatase which suggests that additional er stress activated signals apart from ca release are required to stimulate the proautophagic activity of the kinase . however an alternative and intriguing possibility could involve a differential regulation of the ire1 rnase activity required for xbp1 mrna splicing and ire1traf2 complex formation required to activate proapoptotic jnk signaling by a different subset of proapoptotic proteins at the er membrane . activation of this er stress response induces the up regulation of several genes including the stress regulated protein p8 and its downstream targets atf4 and chop and the pseudokinase trb3 which are required for the stimulation of autophagy in response to cannabinoid action . on the other hand autophagy may endorse the proapoptotic functions of certain er stress pathways see also section 4.1 or become a lethal backup pathway in cancer cells with defect on apoptotic signaling 133 148 . by contrast cannabinoid treatment activates er stress and autophagy leading to apoptotic cell death of glioma and pancreatic cancer cells but not of nontransformed embryonic fribroblasts or primary astrocytes in which neither er stress nor autophagy is activated in response to the treatment with these compounds . as discussed above the er stress response is activated to protect the cells from different alterations affecting this organelle . however when the intensity or duration of the er damage can not be restored by this response er stress can also lead to cell death . er stressed bi1 deficient cells displayed ire1 hyperactivation along with an increased xbp1 mrna splicing and expression of xbp1s dependent genes thus unraveling a paradoxical role of bi1 as inhibitor of the cytoprotective ire1 branch of the upr in mildly er stressed cells . thus different factors such as the intensity of the er stress signal the simultaneous activation of additional pathways the cell type and so forth must be integrated to yield a specific autophagic response . our data indicate that induction of autophagy in response to thc treatment relies on the eif2 phosphorylation dependent upregulation of the transcription factors p8 atf4 and chop as well as of the pseudokinase trb3 four genes that had been previously identified as essential mediators of thc action in cancer cells 122 123 . the normal rate of autophagy in the cell is low and therefore this cellular process only becomes activated in response to certain situations . in addition jnk has been shown to control beclin1 expression to regulate ceramide induced autophagy . as discussed in the previous section the mechanism responsible for the activation of autophagy upon thc administration relies on a cannabinoid receptors induced early accumulation of de novo synthesized ceramide an event that takes place in the er which leads in turn to er dilation and increased eif2 phosphorylation . one of the mechanisms connecting ca release from the er and autophagy is the stimulation of ampk . recently the er associated bax inhibitor1 bi1 an evolutionary conserved antiapoptotic protein has been identified as a new player in the regulation of ire1 by bcl2 family members and their modulators . the main effector of perk mediated apoptosis is the proapoptotic transcription factor chop c ebp homologous protein gadd153 which can be induced by atf4 atf6 as well as xbp1s . these observations suggest that the xbp1 may play a different role than traf2jnk on the regulation of autophagy by the ire1 arm of the upr . er stress sets in motion an evolutionary conserved and integrated signal transduction pathway known as the unfolded protein response upr . induction of autophagy in er stressed cells unable to mount an apoptotic response because of bax bak deficiency results in increased photokilling suggesting the activation of an conversely in apoptosis competent cells blocking autophagy stimulation following er stress by sirnas that target essential modulators of the autophagic machinery sensitizes to cell death thus revealing a cytoprotective role for this pathway dewaele m. and agostinis p. unpublished results . dapk is a ser thr kinase that plays an important role as tumor suppressor due to its ability to promote apoptosis and autophagy . indeed autophagy was shown to be activated in mcf7 cells treated with bortezomib by a mechanism which involved proteasomal stabilization of atf4 and atf4 dependent upregulation of lc3b . on the other hand eif2 phosphorylation seems to be also important for autophagy as induced by other er stress related or unrelated stimuli 75 120 121 . thus knock down of pkc but not inactivation of the upr signalling routes prevented autophagy as induced by acute er stress . bi1 at the er was found to be capable to interact through its c terminus domain with ire1 and to inhibit ire1 signaling in vitro as well as in mice and flies conferring increased resistance under conditions of mild er stress . understanding the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate the extent of autophagy activation in response to different triggering signals as well as the ones that control the interplay of this cellular process with apoptosis is therefore crucial to design new antitumoral therapies based on the modulation of the er stress autophagy response . another important regulator of tsc2 is the amp activated protein kinase ampk which phosphorylates tsc2 in a different residue than akt leading to activation of tsc12 inactivation of rheb and inhibition of mtorc1 . thus autophagy has been proposed to protect from apoptosis operate as an alternative cell death mechanism e.g. these observations suggest that ampk may play an important role in the regulation of autophagy in response to different ca dependent and independent stress signals . surprisingly whether autophagy enhances apoptosis induced by proteasomal inhibitors or not seems to depend on whether the treated cells are transformed or not . a constellation of er localized bcl2 family members including bax bak bik nbk and bcl2 has been shown to be engaged in the control of er ca homeostasis 4446 for an extensive review see 13 47 . as discussed in the previous section some of the key regulatory steps in the activation of autophagy upon stimulation of er stress such as mtorc1 inhibition or the interaction of beclin1 with bcl2 can also receive signals derived from different inputs including those not directly related with er stress . depending on the cellular context activation of jnk can either allow the cells to adapt to er stress by initiating autophagy or as discussed further promote apoptosis in response to persistent or irrecoverable er stress . proteasomal degradation and autophagy are the two main mechanisms that are in charge of protein clearance in the cell . indeed it was shown that bortezomib sensitized pancreatic cancer cells to er stress mediated apoptosis . consequently depending on whether pharmacological or genetic inhibition of autophagy enhances or prevents cell death activation of autophagy after er stress has been assigned respectively a cytotoxic 75 115 119 132 145147 or a protective 5 6 115 119 128 role . regarding the signalling pathways by which eif2 phosphorylation can modulate autophagy kouroku and et al showed that perk eif2dependent atg12 upregulation is required for induction of autophagy in response to polyq protein accumulation which suggests that controlling the expression of autophagy related genes by eif2 downstream targets could be one of the mechanisms connecting both events . like ire1 perk is a type i transmembrane protein with a luminal sensing domain and a cytosolic kinase domain which becomes activated following dimerization . targeting proteasomal degradation has proven to be a valuable approach in various cancer treatments and proteasome inhibitors have emerged as a new class of er stress agents . trb3 plays a crucial role in the induction of autophagy upon thc administration through its inhibitory interaction with akt which leads in turn to mtorc1 inhibition . in agreement with these observations treatment of mice with thc decreased mtorc1 activity stimulated autophagy and apoptosis and reduced tumor growth in xenografts generated with p8 cells but not in those generated with p8 cells in which trb3 is not up regulated in response to thc further confirming that the p8trb3 pathway plays an essential role in the activation of autophagy and cell death by cannabinoids also in vivo . of interest pharmacological or genetic inhibition of autophagy prevented cannabinoid induced cell death as well as apoptosis whereas abrogation of apoptosis prevented cell death but not autophagy as induced by these agents . in any case further research is still necessary to understand the complex lipid protein and protein protein interactions that regulate the formation of the i m . moreover in order to clear the er from the accumulation of terminally misfolded protein aggregates that can not be degraded by the proteasome the upr may upregulate the autophagy machinery 5 6 . another link between ca er stress and autophagy relies on the modulation of the inositol 145trisphosphate receptor ip3r . showed that trb3 knock down sensitized the cells to cell death during tunicamycin treatment . the upr primarily aims at ameliorating the protein load on the er by coordinating the temporal shut down in protein translation along with a complex program of gene transcription to increase er folding capacity . accumulation of pip3 seems to be crucial for the recruitment of autophagy proteins such as atg18wipi1 to the i m which is important for atg9 trafficking and therefore for the initiation of the autophagic process . in addition mtorc1 has been proposed to regulate autophagy by repressing the activity of the atg1atg13atg17fip200 complex 9295 . moreover as mentioned before several bcl2 family members localize at the er and regulate both calcium levels as well as signal transduction through the upr . although it is clear that chop fulfills an important role in er stress induced apoptosis the fact that perk and eif2 ser51ala knock in cells are unable to induce chop yet are very susceptible to er stress 58 59 unravels the dual role of the perk axis in triggering both adaptive and proapoptotic processes . bcl2 family proteins which consist of proapoptotic multidomain proteins e.g. likewise autophagy can help cells to cope with er stress for instance contributing to the elimination of unfolded or aggregated proteins or participate in the mechanism of er stress induced cell death 115 117119 . tumor cells are bathed in a hostile microenvironment and confronted with chronic metabolic stress conditions that favor the activation of adaptive mechanisms such as the upr and autophagy 10 11.moreover certain promising anticancer regimens have been shown to activate concomitantly er stress and autophagy in cancer cells see section 4 . while a growing number of reports have started to identify molecular elements of the cross talk between er stress and autophagy see section 3.2 thus unraveling potential druggable targets knowledge of the functional outcome of the activation of these pathways in cancer cells responding to chemotherapeutics is still very limited . showed that reconstituting bak expression at the er membranes in dko cells is sufficient to reestablish ire1traf2 activation and mitochondrial apoptosis as discussed further in section 2.3 instigated by reticular forms of the bh3only proteins bim and puma . thus treatment with tunicamycin or thapsigargin or treatment with proteasome inhibitors induced autophagy on an ire1dependent manner . accordingly autophagy plays a dual role in cancer . this receptor releases ca from er stores in response to different cellular signals although it could also play additional functions derived from its ability to interact with different proteins including members of the bcl2 family . as p53 modulates autophagy through different mechanisms 112 136138 this could be another way by which dapk could regulate autophagy in response to certain er stress stimuli . the antitumoral action of cannabinoids is based on the ability of these agents to inhibit tumor angiogenesis and activate apoptosis of cancer cells 157 158 . while the molecular mechanism underlying their mitochondrial action is still a matter of debate it is becoming clear that bcl2 family proteins can exert a tight control on apoptosis at different subcellular sites . this explains the high efficacy of bortezomib treatment against types of cancer cells in which the er is already predisposed with a considerable load . interestingly in another study using human fibrosarcoma cells overexpression of bi1 inhibited ros production downstream er stress through the upregulation of ho1 an effector of the perk pathway as described previously . this perk function was linked to the ability of atf4 to regulate the expression of genes involved in glutathione biosynthesis and antioxidant response . the in vivo relevance of these findings was demonstrated by the observation that cannabinoid treatment reduced tumor growth and activated autophagy and apoptosis in subcutaneous tumor xenografts derived from human u87 mg astrocytoma cells and transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts mefs . other transcriptional targets include proteins increasing er chaperone activity and degrading of er client proteins 37 39 . ampk is considered an important energy sensor that becomes activated upon atp cellular depletion or phosphorylation by different kinases . the protein kinase c theta pkc has been also implicated in regulating autophagy in response to er stress in a calcium dependent manner . similar to perk ire1 signaling has also been implicated in promoting or impairing cell survival . it is therefore conceivable that activation of the ire1traf2jnk arm of er stress may regulate autophagy through modulation of beclin1 function and expression . thus ire1 can promote cell death by recruiting a traf2ask1 complex leading to the activation of jnk and p38 mapk cascades 25 26 . jttel and coworkers showed that increases in cytosolic ca concentration upon treatment with different er stress inducers stimulate camkk leading in turn to ampk activation inhibition of mtorc1 and autophagy stimulation . in any case further research is still necessary to clarify the precise mechanisms by which eif2 phosphorylation regulates autophagy in response to different er stress signals . the elongation of the initial autophagic membrane requires the participation of two ubiquitin like protein conjugation systems which modify the autophagy proteins atg5 and atg8lc3 . moreover abundant evidence claims for a critical role of proapoptotic bcl2 family proteins in the induction of apoptosis following er stress . different situations that induce er stress also lead to induction of autophagy . as discussed in the following sections modulation of mtorc1 activity is one of the mechanisms by which er stress and autophagy become connected . a wide array of conventional and experimental chemotherapeutic agents has been shown to stimulate er stress and activation of upr along with autophagy in cancer cells . consistent with its predominant reticular localization in cultured cells light activation of hypericin is coupled with massive er expansion preceding ultrastructural features of apoptosis both in vitro and in bladder cancer bearing rats verfaillie t. and agostinis p. unpublished observations and stimulation of upr . they function as gatekeepers antiapoptotic bcl2 or gatecrashers proapoptotic bax bak of the outer mitochondrial membrane . moreover different anticancer treatments activate autophagy in tumor cells which has been proposed to either enhance cancer cell death or act as a mechanism of resistance to chemotherapy 110115 . these processes are assisted and monitored by several resident chaperones and ca binding proteins including the glucose regulated proteins such as grp78 or bip immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein calreticulin and calnexin and several folding enzymes such as the thioredoxin like protein disulfide isomerase pdi . although atf6 is neither essential for basal expression of er chaperones nor for embryonic or postnatal development it plays an important role in recovery from acute er stress and adapting cells to chronic er stress . as explained above several kinases regulate mtorc1 including ampk which inhibits mtorc1 by activating tsc2 . pdt with various agents has been shown to induce apoptosis along with autophagy and in most cases autophagy is activated as a mean to protect cells from killing . here we discuss further a selected group of clinically used or promising cytotoxic drugs with a demonstrated ability of inducing both upr and autophagy as paradigms to discuss the potential of targeting these pathways in cancer therapy . an interesting molecular switch between the prosurvival and prodeath functions of the perk pathway could involve the human orthologue of the drosophila tribble protein trb3 a downstream transcriptional target of chop . an important problem at the time of predicting whether induction of er stress will activate autophagy in a protective or cytotoxic way is our relative lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which autophagy regulates cell death . moreover recent evidence suggests that when used in combination with certain cytotoxic drugs such as pdt proteasomal inhibitors are capable of enhancing their anticancer efficacy making these agents a very promising class of pharmacological agents in combinatorial therapy . for example tunicamycin thapsigargin and brefeldin a activate autophagy in colon and prostate cancer cells thus mitigating er stress and protecting against cell death .", "it is known that

appeared that decreased blood glucose levels correlated to increased pain in the insulin treatment group . the objective of this present research was to study the molecular mechanisms of acute

is responsible for the early worsening of retinopathy and acute pain . this in turn may be the mechanism by which acute pain is induced in the body . patients with diabetes may face the difficult situation where tight blood glucose control can reduce the risk of diabetic complications however this degree of control may also increase the risk of dangerous hypoglycemic episodes . in the linked

a crosstalk between brca1 lipogenesis adipogenesis obesity and obesity associated ir . subjects with obesity and a high degree of ir have a clear rise in gene and protein expression of the ror1 receptor in adipose tissue especially in the visceral depot . but lipogenesis is not the only process involved other crucial processes for the normal function of the adipose tissue are adipogenesis apoptosis and angiogenesis necessary processes to help in the adipose tissue expansion in order to avoid future metabolic disturbances caused by the excess of fatty acids . this is closely associated with the storage capacity in adipose and muscle tissues with the mismatch between energy surplus and storage capacity in adipose tissue and muscle tissues possibly being an important factor linking obesity and ir . this suggests that ror1 may be added to the list of nuclear receptors in adipose tissue that could be used to modulate the ir associated with obesity . this is reflected in the so called adipose tissue expandability hypothesis where the pathological expansion of abdominal adipose tissue in morbid obesity reaches a threshold characterized by an inability of adipose tissue to expand because its capacity to recruit new adipocytes is exhausted . the great revolution in the study of the adipose tissue though has been the isolation and characterization of an adipose tissue derived multipotent stem cell population ho msc . however adipose tissue buffering is impaired in obesity through defects in the ability of adipose tissue to respond rapidly . in our laboratory much interest has been generated after finding that morbidly obese subjects with low insulin resistance had higher adipose tissue vegf a levels than obese subjects with high insulin resistance hypothesizing that upregulation of vegf a in adipose tissue could have a relationship with ir believing that its upregulation is a compensatory mechanism that replaces the reduction in vegf b vegf c and vegf d . we have suggested that the adipose tissue and the liver may act in a balanced manner depending on the ir status as a decrease in fabp4 expression was observed in adipose tissue from metabolically obese patients versus metabolically healthy humans while the opposite takes place in the liver with an increase in fabp4 expression in metabolically obese patients with the ir status being an important determinant in tissue expression . it is therefore very important to understand the signaling factors that control adipose tissue expansion . it is well recognized that adipose tissue storage capacity for fatty acids prevents lipotoxicity in other tissues . this suggests that the factor linking obesity diabetes and associated comorbidities may not be the absolute amount of fat accumulated but the mismatch between energy surplus and storage capacity . recently we found an increase in proapoptotic casp37 gene expression and a decrease in antiapoptotic bcl2 gene expression in adipose tissue both vat and sat with the increase in body fat mass . thus taking together the increased expression of the brca1 gene and the reduced expression of many lipogenic factors could be interpreted as the process through which cells reduce their ability to synthesize additional fatty acids once the limit in the storage capacity of the adipocytes is attained . thus changes in lipid storing capacity and lipid mobilization processes in adipocytes represent important elements of adipose tissue dysfunction . this has opened up new possibilities especially concerning the study of how this multipotent stem cell population resident in the adipose tissue is affected by or contributes to tissue dysfunction .", "2 . repeat chest ct scan showed significant improvement . post operatively intestinal peristalsis did not recover and a gastrointestinal decompression tube was placed in the duodenum . alp typically occurs during the active stage of sle thus emergency surgery may increase the rate of this complication . the patient was thought to have strangulated intestinal obstruction and an emergency laparotomy was performed . in conclusion we report the first case of alp and ipso co existing in a patient with sle . herein we report a case in which ipso was the initial presentation of sle and secondary onset of alp occurred after emergency surgery . ipso and alp occurring in a single patient described as co manifestation with sle has not been reported previously . therefore the present case supports the hypothesis that the clinical features of aipo in sle patients appear to be the result of a primary intestinal smooth muscle myopathy similar to that in cipo . the present study presents a rare case in which ipso was the initial presentation of sle with secondary onset of alp after emergency surgery . emergency surgery has been shown to be an independent risk factor for increasing the complication rate and morbidity of sle patients 1516 . the patient s clinical symptoms were ameliorated and the radiographic results showed improvement following high dose methylprednisolone gamma globulin supplement therapy for 3 days followed by 2 mg kg methylprednisolone as maintenance treatment . cases in whom ipso is the primary clinical feature are typically associated with connective tissue diseases . intestinal pseudo obstruction ipso is defined as ineffective intestinal propulsion which occurs in the absence of mechanical or obstructive factors 1 . to the best of our knowledge there have been no previous reports of ipso and alp occurring in a single patient . in the present case infective pneumonia was excluded as a comprehensive infectious work up was negative and anti infective treatment was ineffective . as in the present case the clinical manifestations of ipso include abdominal pain nausea vomiting absence of bowel sounds and may include constipation and fever 4 . ureterohydronephrosis is highly associated with ipso in sle 1410 as repeated urinalysis examination results were negative ureterohydronephrosis did not occur in this patient . in the present case although the sledai score was 10 alp occurred which may be explained by the emergency surgery performed for ipso . alp typically occurs during the active stage of sle which may partially explain why mortality in alp is 50 even when treated with large doses of steroids 14

different airway specimen sputum and bal obtained from patients with cf and enac transgenic enac tg mice with cf like lung disease 2628 and correlated dna levels with proinflammatory cxc chemokines characteristic cf pathogens and measurements of lung function . in cf airway fluids we found dna net like structures associated with bacteria figure 1e . these findings provide evidence that cf lung disease features free airway dna levels characteristic for netosis and suggest that increased free dna levels are associated with poor lung function of cf patients . based on the increasing extent of neutrophilic inflammation and pulmonary obstruction the evidence of free net like dna structures in cf airways tempts us to speculate that in earlier and milder stages of cf lung disease net formation may act beneficial in providing extracellular antibacterial and antifungal host defense . stratifying cf patients for disease severity we found that cf patients with poor pulmonary function had higher levels of free dna in their airway fluids than patients with mild lung disease figure 2a . treatment of cf airway fluids with dnase dissolved these dna net like structures further confirming their nature as dna strands data not shown . also consistent with the data obtained from human cf lung disease samples the extent of free dna in murine cf airway fluids correlated positively with the levels of the cxcr2 ligand cxcl2 figure 3c and with pulmonary obstruction parameters fev100 figure 3d whereas no correlation was found between free dna and levels of cxcl1 or parameters of pulmonary restriction parameters data not shown . similar to human cf airway fluids levels of the cxcr2 ligands cxcl1 and cxcl2 figure 3a and free dna figure 3b were highly increased in the bal airway fluids of enac tg mice compared to wild type controls . the fixed samples were washed with pbs permeabilized and blocked 10 normal goat serum 10 mm glycine 0.2 tween 20 in diluent containing 0.5 bovine serum albumin and 0.5 triton x100 in pbs . our correlations between free dna levels and pulmonary obstruction parameters in human patients with cf and a mouse model of cf lung disease suggest that at least in our cf cohort with a more advanced lung disease severity nets may cause more harm than good to the host . we and others have demonstrated previously that free dna net like structures are abundantly detectable in cf airway secretions 1014 . remarkably most abundant free dna was found in cf sputa whereas in bal and lung tissue lower amounts of free dna strands were detected which is consistent with the observation that neutrophilic inflammation is most prominent in the proximal bronchial airway compartments in cf lung disease . our results demonstrate that free airway dna levels correlate with obstructive lung disease and proinflammatory chemokines in cf patients and cf mice and could serve as therapeutic target and potential biomarker in cf lung disease . the fixed samples were washed with pbs permeabilized 0.5 triton x100 in pbs and blocked 10 normal goat serum 10 mm glycine in diluent containing 0.5 bovine serum albumin 0.5 normal goat serum and 0.5 triton x100 in pbs . in summary our study in line with previous investigations demonstrates that free dna with net like characteristics represents an extracellular component of cf airway fluids . several studies have now provided evidence for netosis or netosis like structures in cf lung disease and broadened the potential role of net formation in the complex pathogenesis of infective cf lung disease . postfixation was performed with 1 osmium tetroxide buffered at ph 6.5 with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate and 0.05 ruthenium red for 2 h at rt . positive costaining for neutrophil elastase figure 1a and citrullinated histones figures 1a 1b and 1d as characteristic net markers and negative staining for f actin figure 1d supported the notion that the cf airway dna fibres represented nets rather than necrosis derived dna . previous studies also provided evidence that free extracellular dna is highly increased in cf airway specimen initially referred to as dna derived from necrotic cells . increased extracellular dna fibres with morphological net characteristics were found in airway specimen from cf patients figures 1a and 1b .", "when this was converted into 100 points the score was found to be about 52

disabled children who rely on others for an extended period of time due to a lack of independence tend to cause long term parenting stress in mothers . the present study aimed to examine the relationship between parenting participation by fathers and parenting stress experienced by mothers with disabled children . however with reference to the subscales of mothers parenting stress the score on dysfunctional interaction with children revealed a significant negative correlation with fathers participation in guidance as well as the total score on parenting participation by fathers . however although dysfunctional interaction with children and difficult child had significant positive correlations with both fathers parenting participation and mothers parenting stress the correlation was below a moderate level . furthermore son found a mediating role of mothers parenting stress on the relationship between fathers parenting participation with disabled children and mother s parenting efficacy8 . son examined a structural relationship among parenting participation by fathers parenting stress of mothers and parenting efficacy and verified a mediating effect of mothers parenting stress on the relationship between fathers parenting participation with disabled children and fathers parenting efficacy . with reference to the subscales of parenting participation by fathers and parenting stress experienced by mothers fathers scores on interaction with the family guidance housekeeping activities and recognition play and leisure activities showed a significant negative correlation on mothers distress score . however fathers parenting participation as a factor for parenting stress in mothers with disabled children has not been adequately studied . parenting stress among mothers is elicited by psychological and child related factors as well as environmental factors such as family income and supporting factors including fathers parenting participation4567 . thus the objective of this study was to examine a novel concept regarding the role of fathers by investigating the relationship between fathers parenting participation and the parenting stress experienced by mothers who are primary caregivers for disabled children . the present study explored the relationship between fathers parenting participation as perceived by mothers and mothers parenting stress . future research investigating the factors that influence fathers parenting participation may be useful as this has yet to be studied . a higher level of parenting participation by fathers was associated with a lower level of parenting stress in mothers .", "in 1978 . on immunohistochemistry the cells were positive for cd68 figure 4 but negative for s100 cd34 cd21 cd35 and hmb45 supporting a diagnosis of spindle cell histiocytic tumor . since the accurate diagnosis of a specific disorder within the jxg subgroup is quite difficult we made the diagnosis of pnh based on the history presence of the typical skin lesions progressive course and histopathological demonstration of spindle cells that were positive on immunohistochemistry for histiocyte marker cd68 but negative for s100 . the spindle cells had oval to elongated benign looking nuclei with vesicular chromatin and small nucleoli . according to weitzman and jaffee they present positive reaction to factor xiiia cd68 cd14 and negative reactions to cd1a and s100 proteins . a cellular tumor was seen centered in the dermis composed of sheets of oval to spindle shaped cells arranged haphazardly in short fascicles and in a storiform pattern at places figures 3a c . prior to presentation to us he underwent intra lesional steroid therapy using triamcinolone acetonide in the peri orbital lesions with good response

moderate pain in the region of the tumor both at rest and on movement or when bone bears any weight . in the maxillofacial region dfs usually are painless slow growing firm masses . tumors such as fibrous histiocytoma fibrous dysplasia or a low grade intra osseous osteosarcoma tumor like lesions such as aneurysmal bone cyst and the juvenile bone cyst can also present with a similar clinical picture . this is very similar to the histopathological picture of the df and a definitive diagnosis is possible only with postoperative clinical development . a similar history of a painless radiographic appearance may vary from uni locular to multi locular with or without expansion or perforation of cortical plates according to frick et al . computed tomography scan showing buccal and lingual cortical plate expansion surgical excision of the lesion the hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue section showed hypo and hyper cellular areas with proliferation of plump fibroblasts arranged

a focus of dense collagenous stroma with focal areas of hyalinization he stain 10 a final diagnosis of df was arrived at after histopathological examination . when differentiating it from other neoplasms that behave aggressively a history of expansion or perforation of the cortical plates along with the histopathological confirmation would be a pointer in the right direction . histologically the df contains mature fibrous connective tissue low to variable cellularity and spindle shaped fibroblasts myofibroblasts with uniform long nuclei in an abundant stroma of collagenous matrix lacking cellular pleomorphism nuclear hyperchromatism or mitoses . the ct in our case clearly showed cortical expansion without any resorption or displacement of adjacent teeth . the differential diagnosis to be considered histologically would be spindle cell tumors of which low grade fibrosarcoma is the most important . though fibrosarcoma exhibits a highly cellular stroma along with high grades of polymorphism and mitosis the low grade variant shows a collagen rich tissue with low cell count and no mitotic activity .", "vertical ground reaction force the joint moments that can predict the amplitude of the vertical ground reaction force in each group for the young males and females and elderly women groups the knee extension moment during the early stance phase was related to the minimum value of the vertical ground reaction force at mid stance . although the knee joint moment was associated with the first peak of the vertical ground reaction force in the young females the hip joint moment was associated with the first peak of the vertical ground reaction force in the elderly females . on the other hand for young females the knee extension moment during the early stance phase was related to the first peak of the vertical ground reaction force . in contrast for the group of elderly females the hip extension moment was related to the first peak of the vertical ground reaction force and the ankle plantarflexor moment was related to the second peak of vertical ground reaction force . the second peak of the vertical ground reaction force exhibited a significant interaction between age and gender and the elderly females had a significantly lower second peak of vertical ground reaction force than the younger females . for young males the knee extension moment during the late stance phase was related to the second peak of the vertical ground reaction force . it is probables that because the elderly females had a lower plantarflexion moment of the ankle than that of young females the second peak of the vertical ground reaction force was smaller in the elderly females in this study . this study examined the relationships between the vertical ground reaction force and hip knee and ankle joint moments during walking in young and elderly individuals . moreover if elderly people exhibit an age related alteration in support moment of the lower extremity changes in joint moment may affect the magnitude of the vertical ground reaction force . in the elderly females of this study the extension moment of the hip had a positive relationship with the first peak of the ground reaction force . knee extension moment during early stance had a negative relationship with the minimum value at mid stance and the knee extension moment during late stance had a positive relation with the second peak of the vertical ground reaction force the young males . therefore the purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between the vertical ground reaction force and the hip knee and ankle joint moments during walking by the elderly and young individuals . relationships among the peak values of the hip knee and ankle joint moments during the early stance phase and the first peak force and the minimum value of the vertical ground reaction force were investigated . the extension moment during the early stance phase of the knee had a negative relationship with the minimum value of the ground reaction force at mid stance in the elderly females . relationships among the peak values of the hip knee and ankle joint moments during the late stance phase and the second peak force of the vertical ground reaction force were also investigated . two way analysis of covariance was also performed to examine the difference between the elderly and the young and the interactions between age and gender with the vertical ground reaction force and peak values of each joint moment using walking speed as the covariate . the first peak and the minimum value at mid stance of the vertical ground reaction force were not significantly different between the elderly and the young . several studies have reported that elderly individuals exhibit age related alteration in their kinetic profiles of walking . the relationship between the vertical ground reaction force and lower extremity joint moments during walking in both elderly and young subjects were investigated . we hypothesized that the relation between the joint moments and vertical ground reaction force differs between the elderly and the young similar to our previous study16 and that there is an age related change in the support strategy use for walking . thus in order to maximize the ability to determine the effects of age on walking the study subjects were divided by gender . the knee extension moment during early stance had a positive relation with the first peak force and a negative relation with the minimum value at mid stance of the ground reaction force of the young females . moreover the plantarflexion moment of the ankle had a positive relationship with the second peak of the ground reaction force of the elderly females . because the amplitude of the peak vertical ground reaction force is affected by cadence rather than stride length23 there may be no difference between the elderly and young people in the first peak of the vertical ground reaction force . age related alterations in lower extremity joint moment suggest there is a difference in the support strategy between the elderly and the young . in our previous study16 the knee extension moment during late stance was associated with the anterior component of the ground reaction force of young males and the knee joint moment was associated with the antero posterior component of the ground reaction force of young females . therefore there are gender differences in the age related changes of walking characteristics and elderly males make use of various joint moment patterns to the control of the vertical ground reaction force . although the flexion moment during the terminal stance phase of the knee exhibited a significant interaction between age and gender there was no significant difference between the age groups neither in malese nor in females . vertical ground reaction force and the joint moments related to the vertical ground reaction force are shown in fig . the knee extension moment of young people is important for decreasing the reaction force from the ground to the body at mid stance and increasing the ground reaction force during weight acceptance and the push off phase . the elderly females had a large hip extension moment and their ground reaction force during the early stance phase was relatively high . by analyzing the relationships between vertical ground reaction force and lower extremity joint moments it would be possible to clarify the difference in the support strategies of elderly and young people . graph representation of the vertical ground reaction forces and the joint moment of the hip knee and ankle during a gait cycle two way analysis of variance was performed to examine the differences between the elderly and the young and the interactions between age and gender with age body height body weight body mass index bmi and spatio temporal parameters . in contrast no factors related to the first peak and second peak forces and the minimum value of the vertical ground reaction force of the elderly males were found . first and second peaks of vertical ground reaction force and the minimum value between the two peaks were extracted from the ground reaction force profile fig 1.graph representation of the vertical ground reaction forces and the joint moment of the hip knee and ankle during a

. flukb includes entries from iedb that bind hla class i or ii allele with at least one positive result or those reported as t cell epitopes . besides sequence search the flukb entries can be searched for t cell epitopes and b cell epitopes . an example of the redundancy is shown in table 1 where the host mallard is found in 16457 of the flukb entries described by 14 different terms . the data repository within flukb contains four types of data protein sequence data hla related data t cell epitopes and hla ligands 3d crystal structures and neutralizing antibody related data . flukb is a unique data mining system for largely automated knowledge discovery from the ever increasing body of influenza data with applications in both t cell and b cell immunology and vaccinology . to enable automated data mining and workflows we created data mining keys from the original nomenclature of influenza viruses with standardized terms . the t cell epitope prediction tools for hla class i and class ii have been integrated within flukb for vaccine related analyses . the datasets in flukb consist of curated enriched and standardized protein sequence data immunological data from multiple data sources and a set of modular analysis tools . the standardized data mining key in flukb enables sequence similarity searching and the display of a sequence s origin on the world map . this information can be used for the analysis of changes in t cell and b cell epitopes . flukb is a knowledge based system that integrates multiple types of influenza data and analytical tools into such workflows to support vaccine target discovery . the immunological data extracted from iedb include t cell epitope sequence epitope type hla binding naturally processed or t cell epitope pubmed references experimental methods and results and hla allele restriction figure 2 lower path . the main tools for the analysis of variability are blast search that can be accessed from individual entries figure 3 find similar sequences or from the sequence alignment under the tools tab . entries without the data mining key are made unavailable to the analysis on flukb as inclusion of entries that lack data could affect the reliability and the outcome of the results . for example three t cell epitope entries are displayed on the record entry page figure 3 . each sequence entry contains information about location host and time of isolation as well as a standardized nomenclature for identification of strains . for each neutralizing antibody the following descriptive information is provided in the flukb isolation information from human samples or from antibody phage display libraries from the primary literature the corresponding crystal structure of antibody ha complex from the pdb database the b cell epitope sequence variants detected from experimentally validated strains and computationally defined b cell epitopes on ha protein displayed as both sequence and 3d structure with jmol . the user can query the sequence entries for information such as the type protein subtype year range country province host original nomenclature and sequence type fragment or full protein by keyword search . the variability analysis can be performed interactively but the variability analysis tools are also integrated in the t cell and b cell mapping tools and relevant workflows . the flukb was developed focusing on a different purpose the facilitation of data mining for influenza vaccinology and immunology of influenza infection . the first is a keyword search that enables the user to extract the data of flukb into specific subsets and the second is a sequence similarity search by blast . epitope block entropy t cell epitopes uses protein subsets selection window that enables the input of epitope sequence . data mining for vaccine targets often requires the analysis of subsets of data for example patient data such as specific hla profile age group phenotypes or other factors . the data mining keys are furthermore nomenclature crucial for the automation of computational analyses standardization of nomenclature fields allows the computer to interpret the data automatically which previously was limited . furthermore we developed a standardized nomenclature to enable and speed up data mining using automated workflows . these search types are vital for the following data analysis as they enable the user to select the needed datasets based on specific scientific questions . flukb offers the capability to address complex questions relating to sequence variability on very specific subsets identification of potential t cell epitopes and selection and combination of these epitopes into polyvalent vaccine constructs . the data mining keys utilized ncbis taxid

strategies of alf secondary to amanita phalloides intoxication . the clinical picture of amanita phalloides intoxication as the toxins are not irritating by themselves the initial phase is characterized by the absence of any signs or symptoms . since the number of patients with amatoxin poisoning evaluated for lt is quite small the most widely used criteria for urgent lt in patients with alf are those of the king s college hospital described by ogrady et al . according to retrospective data most authors indicate that silibinin and n acetylcysteine nac may be effective in the management of patients with amanita phalloides poisoning 1 2 4 21 . patients with severe liver injury should be admitted to intensive care unit connected to a liver transplant centre . these toxins cause damage of the cellular membrane of the enterocytes and are therefore responsible of the initial gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea vomiting and diarrhea exhibited by almost all the patients . moreover silibinin appears to affect also the secondary uptake in the liver mediated through an enterohepatic recirculation . a complete analysis of the world experience in treatment of amatoxin poisoning was published in 2002 by enjalbert et al . although the exact incidence of mushroom poisoning is not precisely estimated due to a presumably relatively high number of underreporting cases amatoxin poisoning is a worldwide problem . retrospectively analyzed the outcome of a large series of amatoxin intoxication cases and found that predictors of death were the prothrombin index in combination with the serum creatinine level on 310 days after ingestion . however the waiting time on the emergency transplant list if it exists may be very prolonged in other parts of the world and liver transplant may never be performed in others . administration of silibinin is recommended if the patient is seen within 48 hours of ingestion . in contrast in those patients with a favourable outcome a rapid improvement in liver function tests occurs followed by a full recovery and restoration of a normal quality of life . the first goal should be directed to treat dehydration electrolyte abnormalities and metabolic acidosis caused by the gastrointestinal phase of the intoxication . gastroduodenal aspiration through a nasogastric tube has been recommended as a sole technique or

of the plated fractured segment in figure 6b not the distributed bone stresses at the imaginary section figures 1 and 5 . more specifically as t2 approaches vertical its longitudinal stress distribution figure 7c left looks more and more like the vertical t3associated stress figure 7d . vu 0 in figure 6b and the bending moments i.e. naturally the angulation of t0 defined by and would be different for incisal versus molar contact nonetheless qualitatively the stress distributions would be identical . and are representative of the normal perpendicular and shear contact forces respectively on the fractured bone surface if the two segments touch . in the intact mandible and are expressed as equivalent stress distributions figure 5 . t 2 figures 4c and 5c like t1 produces a uniform compression consistent with 2 but because 2 is ccw its associated gradient is t c. so when these 2 longitudinal stress distributions are superimposed figure 7c it is certain that the bottom part of the mandible is in compression but depending on the position of t2 s loa within the shaded region in figure 5c the top part can be in tension stress free or in compression . t2 s loa is bounded by t3 and t0 shaded region in figure 5c so the associated stress distribution can be seen to morph left to right in figure 7c from the tot cob of t3 figure 7d to the complete compression of t0 figure 7a . an fbd used in equilibrium analysis shows all external loads forces and moments that act on an isolated object i.e. combined with the ccw 4 s t c gradient the top portion of the mandible will be in tension but the bottom portion can be in tension stress free or in compression figure 7e . thus of the 11 possibilities depicted in figure 7 only 3 left in figure 7c figure 7d and right in figure 7e are in concert with the lever s tot cob longitudinal stress distribution . more specifically the central issues involve 1 the relationship between occlusal force direction and the associated stress distributions within an intact mandible and 2 the extrapolation of those stress fields to a plated fractured mandible . this tension on top compression on bottom tot cob stress distribution is consistent with the inherent vertical occlusal force of the lever . as t2 s direction approaches t0 its stress distribution figure 7c right starts to resemble the t0 produced stress figure 7a . for the equilibrium of the intact or fractured mandible these moments and t s horizontal and vertical components must be opposed by the internal loads and respectively figures 2b and 4 and 1 . in the plated mandible it is produced by the loads in the plates and by contact between the fractured bone surfaces . as noted above figures 24 and 1 also apply exactly to a plated fractured mandible figure 6a . in conclusion 1 the lever based tension on top compression on bottom tot cob stress gradient should not be assumed in the intact mandible . there is no uniform tension or compression associated with t3 figure 5d because t3 being vertical requires that 0 for equilibrium . thus contrary to popular notion the enlarged gap at the inferior border is not caused by tension on the contrary it is caused by compression in cd. t 3 the lever replica figures 4d and 5d is vertical so there is no 3 equivalent stress . for the plated mandible figure 6b there are an insufficient number of equations to solve for all unknowns . 3 the stress distribution within an intact mandible should not be extrapolated to a plated or otherwise stabilized mandible . its tot cob stress distribution figures 1 and 7d is entirely the equivalent of the ccw 3 . the equivalents of a cw figure 5b and a ccw figures 5c 5d and 5e are stress gradients with compression on top tension on bottom c on top t on bottom and the opposite respectively . the sums according to the superposition principle of those individual stress distributions excluding the associated shear stress yield the net longitudinal tension compression stress gradients shown in figure 7 . but in fact the top plate ab is in tension and cd the bottom plate is in compression and except for the compression at the bone bone contact on top there is no tension which would be impossible anyway at a fracture or compression in bone anywhere along the fracture . if t acts through the circle t0 then the longitudinal stress in the body of the mandible is entirely a uniform compression figures 5a and 7a . elementary engineering beam theory is used to determine the stress systems figure 5 that are equivalent to a specific set of and figure 4 . there have been questions about its class i versus ii versus iii classification or it being a lever in the first place 1416 and the loading assumptions . a uniform stress without a gradient is sufficient for t0 equilibrium figure 5a . that of course is contrary to the tot cob lever based stress distribution figures 1 and 7d . the sums of the 1 associated uniform compression c and the cw 1 associated c t gradients of t1 figures 4b and 5b can combine to produce 3 different net stress distribution patterns figure 7b . this analysis is appropriate for conceptualizing mandibular biomechanics and for casting doubt on the status quo . h v and m are the unknown forces and moments acting within the upper and lower plates directly overlying the bone fracture figure 6b . it is emphasized that 1 and figures 24 essentially and apply identically to the imaginary anterior segment of an intact mandible and to an actual fractured off section but that is where the similarity ends . and as demonstrated its presence has the potential to profoundly alter the stress distribution within the mandible from the generally accepted tot cob figures 1 5d and 7d to as an example exactly the opposite figure 7b left . mu 0 in figure 6b in the plates . and for many reasons obvious and subtle a plated fractured mandible is an entirely different and more complex load bearing structure than an intact mandible . because both 1 and 1 are associated with compression in the top part of the mandible c and c respectively there is no doubt that the top part will be in compression . and finally t4 figures 4e and 5e is different from the others because the 4 equivalent stress is a uniform tension . specifically the lever based two dimensional 2d model figure 1 consists of one force component direction vertical and one moment component direction perpendicular to the page by the right hand rule . similar to the derivation of 1 three independent simultaneous equations of static equilibrium based on the fbd in figure 6b can be obtained by summing forces in the vertical 2 and horizontal 3 directions and by summing moments 4 about the tooth contact point 2tyvuvl0 3txhuhl0 4duhuvumudlhlvlml0 . fortunately solving the problem is not a goal .", ". the in follows closely the same integration mechanism as that of the tn.the burst firing in the ipsilateral ibn inhibits the contralateral ebn in and an as

the plots of dendritic membrane potential first column axonal membrane potential second column and synaptic current pulse train third column of the ipsilateral burst neurons and in in generation of the 16 saccade recall that the train of action potentials is converted to a train of the current pulses in the presynaptic terminal of the neuron to provide excitatory or inhibitory input to the succeeding neurons based on the neural connections in figure 1 . with the stimulation of the lateral rectus muscle by the ipsilateral an and the inhibition of the ipsilateral medial rectus muscle via the on a saccade occurs in the right eye . with the stimulation of the lateral rectus muscle by the ipsilateral an and the inhibition of the ipsilateral medial rectus muscle via the on a saccade occurs in the right eye . this inhibition removes the stimulus to the agonist muscle.the ipsilateral fn stimulation of the contralateral ebn allows for modest bursting in the contralateral ebn . without such appropriate parameters the set of agonist antagonist control inputs to the muscle fiber oculomotor plant supports the time optimal controller in which the motoneurons firing rate does not determine the saccade magnitude . as described the number of active neurons impacts the control of saccades instead of the variations in the firing rate of those neurons under the time optimal control strategy . the neural stimulation signal is the firing rate of the ipsilateral an and that of the contralateral on . as motoneurons receive excitatory input from the ipsilateral ebn the burst discharge in them during a saccade is adequately similar to the ebn bursting . the contralateral ibn then inhibits the ipsilateral ebn tn and an and contralateral on . the contralateral ibn then inhibits the ipsilateral ebn tn and an and contralateral on . simultaneously the contralateral medial rectus muscle is stimulated by the contralateral on and with the inhibition of the contralateral lateral rectus muscle via the an a saccade occurs in the left eye . simultaneously the contralateral medial rectus muscle is stimulated by the contralateral on and with the inhibition of the contralateral lateral rectus muscle via the an a saccade occurs in the left eye . the ipsilateral fn stimulation of the contralateral ebn allows for modest bursting in the contralateral ebn . the ipsilateral llbn and ebn when the opn ceases firing the mlbn ebn and ibn is released from inhibition . the muscle fiber model mfm improves the oculomotor plant model by using several configurations of muscle fibers in series or parallel to drive the eyes to their destination . such coding manifests activities including the onset of burst firing before saccade peak firing rate and end of firing with respect to the saccade termination for each neuron on the basis of the physiological evidence . for the large saccades the duration of the agonist pulse is the dominant factor that determines the saccade magnitude according to the main sequence diagrams the fn in the cerebellum records the duration of the agonist pulse and the number of active neurons in arranging the end of the saccade . the firing rate trajectory of the ebn is of prime importance in control of such a saccade . long lead burst neuron llbn omnipause neuron opn excitatory burst neuron ebn inhibitory burst neuron ibn abducens nucleus an oculomotor nucleus on . once the sc ceases firing the stimulus to the llbn stops allowing the resumption of opn firing that inhibits the ipsilateral and contralateral mlbn hence terminating the saccade . once the sc ceases firing the stimulus to the llbn stops allowing the resumption of opn firing that inhibits the ipsilateral and contralateral mlbn hence terminating the saccade . the termination time of the saccades solely depends on the duration of burst under the time optimal control strategy . the ipsilateral control simulation results of eye position for the two small saccades under the time optimal control strategy are demonstrated in figure 12 . the saccade neural network includes eight neuron populations at premotor and motor levels as seen in figure 1long lead burst neuron llbnomnipause neuron opnexcitatory burst neuron ebninhibitory burst neuron ibntonic neuron tninterneuron inabducens nucleus anoculomotor nucleus on . the parameterized saccadic oculomotor plant for the trend of changes in muscle tensions involved in each saccade is such that neuron data derived active state tensions drive the muscle fiber oculomotor plant . the ipsilateral ibn is stimulated by the ipsilateral llbn and the contralateral fn of the cerebellum . some of the stimulation of the ipsilateral llbn and ibn is lost because of the inhibition of the contralateral fn . some of the stimulation of the ipsilateral llbn and ibn is lost because of the inhibition of the contralateral fn . to develop the quantitative computational models that establish the basis of this functional neural network model a neural circuit model was then demonstrated and parameterized to match the firing characteristics of eight neuron populations at both the premotor and motor stages . the adjustment of the number of active neurons for the large saccades is empirically carried out to maximize the correlation between the whole muscle oculomotor plant and the muscle fiber oculomotor plant . shown in figure 13 are the ipsilateral control simulation results of eye position for the three large saccades under the time optimal control strategy . a neural network model of saccade related neural sites in the midbrain is first presented . we model the saccade induced spiking activities at the premotor level with an hh model for the bursting neurons and with a modified fitzhugh nagumo fhn model for the tonic spiking neurons . the number of active neurons for the 16 and 20 saccades remains relatively the same although the 12 saccade aggregates fewer active neurons as seen in table 3 . obviously the burst tonic firing activity of the an figure 10q reflects the burst firing of the ebn and the tonic firing of the in . when the ipsilateral ebn is weakly stimulated by the contralateral fn it renders a special membrane property that tends to a high frequency burst mechanism until inhibition from the contralateral ibn and the opn . for large saccades however the number of active neurons firing maximally remains unchanged consistent with the time optimal controller described by enderle and wolfe . the firing rate trajectories of a medium lead burst neuron of monkey data for saccades of 4 8 12 16 and 20 are provided . to serve this purpose the neural stimulation signal to the controller is the firing rate of the ipsilateral on and that of the contralateral an . there are two inputs the input from the previous compartment s membrane potential and the input from the next compartment s membrane potential . in other words it elevates the whole muscle model to the level of muscle fiber model by calculating the viscosity and elasticity of the latter model in terms of the parameter values in the former model . the primary inputs to this neuron are the excitatory input of the sc and the inhibitory input from the contralateral ibn and opn the ibn though controls the firing of the ebn as well as the tn both of which are on the opposite side of the network to the corresponding ibn . it represents the sequence of events accounted for by enderle and zhou with modifications made in steps ivvii to indicate the function of local neural integrators tn and in in providing the step component to the motoneurons.the deep layers of the sc initiate a saccade based on the distance between the current position of the eye and the desired target.the ipsilateral llbn and ebn are stimulated by the contralateral sc burst cells . when released from inhibition the ipsilateral ebn responds with a postinhibitory rebound burst for a brief period of time . when released from inhibition the ipsilateral ebn responds with a postinhibitory rebound burst for a brief period of time . during the fixation periods the ins provide the steady state tensions required to keep the eyes at the desired destination.at the termination time the cerebellar vermis operating through the purkinje cells inhibits the contralateral fn and stimulates the ipsilateral fn . the entire active agonist neurons fire maximally during the pulse interval of the saccade . the model is first order time optimal that is it does not depend on the firing rate of the neurons to determine the saccade magnitude . the axon model for all spiking neurons except the ebn and opn adheres to the hodgkin huxley hh model . in contrast to the whole muscle model information about the muscle fibers is not aggregated into just a few parameters in the mfm . the antagonist muscle is unstimulated by a pause during the saccade and remains fixed by a step input to keep the eyeball at its destination . the neurons dendrite model is realized by experimental tuning of the parametric capacitance and resistance properties of the basic dendrite model . it is concluded that the neural network is constrained by a minimum duration of the agonist pulse and that the most dominant factor in determination of the amplitude is the number of active neurons for the small saccades . the presented ebn model showed a constant plateau of bursting during the second portion of the burst before the decay occurs . the ebn when stimulated by the contralateral fn and perhaps the sc enables a special membrane property that causes a high frequency burst that decays slowly until being inhibited by the contralateral ibn . the ebn when stimulated by the contralateral fn and perhaps the sc enables a special membrane property that causes a high frequency burst that decays slowly until being inhibited by the contralateral ibn . for the large saccades however the duration of agonist burst firing is directly related to the saccade magnitude . the number of active neurons is estimated to be 75 neurons for the 12 saccade 100 neurons for the 16 saccade and 92 neurons for the 20 saccade . the rigorous analysis of the mfm including both the length tension and the force velocity characteristics indicates that this model agrees with the previous results from the whole muscle model 3 12 . it is noteworthy that the duration of agonist burst discharge is of prime significance in determining the saccade magnitude as seen in figure 11 . under the time optimal strategy the number of neurons that actively fire and the duration of the agonist pulse determined the saccade magnitude . such burst discharge in the motoneurons is responsible for the movement of the rectus muscles during a saccade . the saccade induced spiking activities at the premotor level are modeled with an hh model for the bursting neurons . we used the first order time optimal controller that includes the activation and deactivation time constants in agonist and antagonist controller inputs to the muscle fiber oculomotor plant . for example the ebn dendritic membrane potential across the first second third and last compartments is illustrated in figure 6 . the dendrite model delineated below is adjustable to the stimulation mechanism of all eight neurons . these models describe how the neural innervation signals from motoneurons are converted to the active state tensions to drive the agonist and antagonist muscle during the saccade assuming that there is an oculomotor plant with a given order . table 3 lists the number of active neurons and the duration of the burst agonist pulse for the five different saccades in this work . synaptic connections between functionally modeled neuron populations are modeled following a current based synapse scheme see table 2 for differences in the membrane parameters among the neurons . the burst duration is found to show similar correlation with the mlbn duration of burst firing from the extracellular single unit recordings . in addition the number of active neurons differs from saccade to saccade as evident by the dynamics observed in the main sequence diagrams 3 12 . the hodgkin huxley hh model of the axon serves as the basis for the neurons modeled here only the ebn and opn are based on a modified hh model . during the pulse phase however the ipsilateral tn is inhibited by the contralateral ibn while the ipsilateral in is inhibited by the ipsilateral ibn . it was concluded that lfps from each neuron encode the eye velocity in both the ipsilateral and contralateral directions . investigation of muscle fiber model is imperative because it allows for recognizing the effects of the firing of individual neurons as well as the number of active neurons firing maximally in controlling the saccades . the first order time optimal controller model is defined by two complementary controllers agonist controller model and antagonist controller model . the neural innervations from this number of neurons for each small saccade of the muscle fiber oculomotor plant tend to be in excellent agreement with those of the whole muscle oculomotor plant . it is indicated that the muscle fiber model substantiates the fact that the number of motoneurons firing has the highest influence on the accuracy of saccade controller contradicting the control strategy of adjusting the firing rates among the whole neurons . as evident by different firing rate trajectories for the ebn this however the duration of the second portion of the burst discharge gradual drop varied among them based on the entire duration of the burst firing in table 3 . the structure of the saccade neural network leverages neural coding so that burst duration is transformed into saccade amplitude under the time optimal condition . it follows from our observations that the duration of the agonist burst firing and the number of active agonist neurons are integral to determining the saccade size see table 3 . 100 identical muscle fibers were connected in series in both the agonist and antagonist muscles in the oculomotor plant . the proposed saccadic circuitry is thus a complete model of saccade generation since it not only includes the neural circuits at both the premotor and motor stages of the saccade generator but also uses a time optimal controller to yield the desired saccade magnitude for both the small and large saccades . note that the above description of the basic hh model of the axon has been used for all burst neurons except for the ebn and the opn . computational efficiency accrues when the minimum number of compartments in the dendrite model is required . we next describe a linear homeomorphic muscle model that captures the nonlinear properties of the muscle namely force velocity and length tension relationships . here we explain that the saccadic eye movement model solution is characterized by realization of the agonist and antagonist controller models thereby providing the active state tensions as inputs to a linear homeomorphic model of the oculomotor plant . all neural populations consisted of 14 dendrite compartments with membrane properties included in table 2 . to encompass all of the desired neural behaviors for the other neurons several modifications to the generic neuron model seem necessary that directly impact its firing rate trajectory 13 . presented in figure 11 are the ipsilateral agonist first and third rows and antagonist second and last rows burst tonic firing rates with their respective active state tensions for the saccades . the last dendrite compartment receives just one input from its preceding compartment . our control strategy was to define two controllers namely agonist and antagonist controller models characterized by the pulse slide step and pause step waveforms respectively . this current pulse flows through the postsynaptic dendritic compartments of the latter neurons thus providing the smooth postsynaptic potentials to prime the axonal compartment .", "2 . thus fda and who publicly expressed serious concerns about electronic

protein levels . the daily use of electronic cigarettes did not hinder the beneficial effects of smoking cessation in this patient . smoking cessation with the use of electronic cigarette led to reversal of chronic idiopathic neutrophilia . cigarette smoking was suggested as a potential cause for this condition in our patient after an extensive diagnostic analysis excluded other possible conditions or intake of medications such as corticosteroids and lithium which are associated with neutrophilia.9 despite the use of medically approved methods the patient failed to quit smoking . flouris et al19 found that no elevation in wbc count was found after electronic cigarette use in comparison wbc and neutrophil counts were significantly elevated immediately after tobacco cigarette smoking.19 farsalinos et al20 studied smokers and electronic cigarette users with echocardiography before and after smoking and electronic cigarette use respectively.20 acute diastolic dysfunction was observed in smokers immediately after smoking 1 cigarette while diastolic function was preserved after using the electronic cigarette for 7 minutes . chronic idiopathic neutrophilia is a condition characterized by elevated white blood cell and neutrophil counts without any underlying disease smoking has been implicated as a potential cause . electronic cigarette use was successful as a smoking cessation tool after two failures to quit smoking one with the use of currently approved pharmaceutical methods . the most important message is that despite the daily use of electronic cigarette by this patient the beneficial effects of smoking cessation were maintained . should they advise patients who have managed to quit smoking by using electronic cigarettes like our patient to stop using them with the risk of smoking relapse and should patients who have repeatedly failed to quit smoking by currently approved methods such as the patient in this study be denied the possibility however small it may be to quit smoking by using electronic cigarettes the daily use of electronic cigarette may help preserve the beneficial effects of smoking cessation . he had 2 unsuccessful attempts to quit smoking one was unassisted and the second was performed with the use of both varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy patches . it will take several years however before such studies are published as awareness and use of electronic cigarettes has increased only recently . to the best of our knowledge this is the first study which reports that smoking cessation with the use of electronic cigarette leads to reversal of chronic idiopathic neutrophilia . in any case regulation and specific quality standards should be implemented as the use of non pharmaceutical grade nicotine or other constituents may lead to the presence of toxic tobacco impurities in the liquids which will be subsequently inhaled by the user.14 although we can not exclude that some constituents of electronic cigarette vapor may have had beneficial effects in reducing wbc count in our patient the most probable explanation is that reversal of cin was caused by smoking cessation itself . the patient had persistently elevated wbc count and mildly elevated c reactive protein levels without any underlying disease . he had two unsuccessful attempts to quit smoking one without any medical treatment in 2006 and one with varenicline plus nicotine patches in 2010 . during the subsequent 6.5 years his leukocyte and c reactive protein levels were repeatedly elevated the condition was consistent with chronic idiopathic neutrophilia . a male caucasian born in 1977 was presented in september 2005 with an elevated wbc count found during a routine check up .", "of 356 patients those

months earlier was admitted to hospital . in the thickened wall there appeared to be several possible diagnoses including ischemic enterocolitis caused by thromboembolism of mesenteric vessels arising from atrial fibrillation inflammatory bowel disease involving the ascending colon and terminal ileum and ischemic or infectious enteritis associated with colon cancer . nonspecific ileitis crohn s disease intestinal tuberculosis or ischemic enteritis were suggested as possible causes of the bowel wall thickening and in order to evaluate the terminal ileum colonoscopic examination was performed . some reports have suggested that earlier diagnosis and surgical resection of diseased bowel together with the use of broad spectrum antibiotics has led to a good outcome 1 6 . several kinds of pathognomic bacteria have been demonstrated in culture or histologically 1 6 gram staining of intestinal lesions has revealed a variety of entities such as streptococci gram positive cocci and gram negative or positive rods . the inflammatory reactions provided no evidence of granuloma formation and the histologic findings were consistent with phlegmonous enteritis phlegmonous enterocolitis is a rare inflammatory bowel disease with a high mortality rate of at least 60 . stool culture yielded lactose fermenting gram negative bacillus urine culture yielded citrobacter freundii and gram staining of urine revealed the presence of gram negative rods no organisms were isolated from blood cultures . subsequent ct scanning showed a markedly dilated small bowel and ascending colon with concentric hyperattenuating focal wall thickening in the hepatic flexure of the ascending colon fig . thus most cases reported in the literature were discovered at autopsy or after the examination of surgical specimens following surgery 1 6 . in our case the early use of broad spectrum antibiotics might have helped his condition to persist . second his clinical course was silent for a long period being discovered only at surgery previously reported cases on the other hand manifested an acute and serious clinical course one which led even to sudden death . 6 reported the ct findings in one case in which only nonspecific small bowel wall thickening with a small amount of ascites was noted .", "on the other hand poma syndrome and gastrointestinal disturbances are associated with anti hu antibodies and furthermore the development of immune complex has been demonstrated in mice with c1300 neuroblastoma tumors confirming the tendency of neuroblastoma to produce immunologic paraneoplastic diseases . furthermore in young children neuroblastoma exceptionally manifests with paraneoplastic opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia poma due to antineuronal nuclear anti hu antibodies which have also been associated with gastrointestinal disturbances such as constipation gut dismotility and paralytic ileus . hypovolemia and the disruption of local renal blood circulation caused acute kidney injury and the signs and symptoms of proximal tubular damage as glucosuria and aminoaciduria . on the other hand the profound hypochloremia was the cause of the metabolic alkalosis instead of metabolic acidosis typically associated with proximal tubular damage . in this patient the presenting signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma included severe dehydration polyglobulia tubulointerstitial damage with acute kidney injury and renal insufficiency electrolyte and acid base unbalancing and heavy glomerular proteinuria . hypovolemia was also responsible for the mild activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system and perhaps for metabolic alkalosis with hypochloremia and hypokalemia but the loss of chloride through sweating was likely the most important cause of this phenomenon . in the subset of cases of neuroblastoma presenting in the context of other congenital abnormalities of the neural crest the association with a germline loss of function mutation of homeobox gene phox2b has been demonstrated on the other hand familial neuroblastoma not associated with other congenital disorders of the neural crest arises from activating mutations of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase alk oncogene whose somatic mutations are however observed in sporadic cases of the disease .", "these mirnas may take part in the regulation of cell cycle in pituitary adenomas together with other related mirnas . accumulating evidence demonstrates that a large number of mirnas have altered expression in pituitary adenomas and these mirnas may play important roles in tumor progression by targeting multiple genes . identified mir26b to be upregulated and mir128 to be downregulated in gh secreting pituitary tumors . mir26b was found to be upregulated in gh secreting pituitary tumors and directly regulate pten . in 2005 mir15a and mir16 1 were reported to have lower expression in both gh secreting and prl secreting pituitary adenomas than in normal tissues and their downregulation was correlated with greater tumor volume and impaired secretion of p43 a potent anticancer cytokine suggesting that mir15a and mir16 1 may function as tumor suppressors and their inactivation may contribute to tumor growth in pituitary adenomas . regarding the deregulation in pituitary adenomas mir15a and mir16 1 may exert their roles as tumor suppressors by regulating cell cycle . mir15a and mir16 1 are the first two mirnas shown to have differential expression in pituitary adenomas . in another study on acth secreting pituitary tumors mir15a and mir16 were also expressed at a lower level but no association between mirnas expression and tumor size was observed in this study . mir184 was markedly upregulated in gh secreting pituitary adenomas and was correlated with tumor diameter . hmga2 overexpression and the decrease of let7 were significantly correlated with tumor proliferation growth invasion and tumor grade which lead to a hypothesis that let7 may also function as a tumor suppressor in pituitary adenomas by targeting hmga2 . according to the hormonal activity pituitary adenomas can be defined as functioning causing endocrine dysfunction such as cushing s disease in acth secreting pituitary adenomas acromegaly in gh secreting pituitary adenomas galactorrhea and amenorrhea in prl secreting pituitary adenomas and hyperthyroidism in tsh secreting pituitary adenomas . in 2009 hmga2 was frequently upregulated in pituitary adenomas including prl acth fsh lh or null cell adenomas but relatively rare in gh and mixed gh prl adenomas . as some mirnas signatures can be used to distinguish pituitary adenomas and normal pituitaries and even subtypes of pituitary tumors it is also possible to develop mirna based diagnosis and therapies of pituitary adenomas . in 2010 another study aimed to identify altered expression of mirnas in gh secreting pituitary adenomas . s study although no association between mirnas expression and tumor size was observed the patients with acth secreting pituitary tumors expressing reduced mir141 had more chance of remission after transsphenoidal surgery suggesting that mir141 may regulate pituitary genes involved in tumor growth and local invasion . identified totally fifty two mirnas to be differentially expressed in gh secreting pituitary adenomas . therefore it is possible that in pituitary adenomas mir15a and mir16 1 influence apoptosis by targeting multiple antiapoptotic genes . in gonadotropin secreting pituitary adenomas a study demonstrated that mir10b was upregulated and mir503 was downregulated . thereby the mirnas targeting tgf signaling mir135a mir140 5p mir582 3p mir582 5p and mir938 may have effects in apoptosis . some mirnas have been demonstrated to target multiple genes indicating that they may have different roles in pituitary tumors . in recent years nevertheless the correlation and function of mirnas and their target genes in pathogenesis of pituitary adenomas remain largely unknown . therefore the mirnas and their targets could regulate pituitary adenomas progression in a complex network . in another study mir124a was the most upregulated mirna and mir31 was the most downregulated mirna in nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas . these data together lead to the hypothesis that many mirnas may function in a network to regulate apoptosis in pituitary adenomas . five mirnas predicted to target smad3 mir135a mir140 5p mir582 3p mir582 5p and mir938 were overexpressed of which mir140 5p has already been validated to target smad3 directly . only a small number of mirnas with their target genes in pituitary adenomas have been validated so far . mir21 was differentially expressed in acth secreting pituitary adenomas compared with normal pituitary tissues . mirnas are also dysregulated in nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas nfa . thus let7 as a regulator of hmga2 may exert its effects in cell cycle control of pituitary adenomas by targeting hmga2 . besides mir107 was found to be overexpressed in gh secreting and nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas and inhibited the expression of pituitary tumor suppressor gene aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein aip . eight mirnas mir183 mir193a5p mir222 mir516b mir524 5p mir601 and mir629 99b were upregulated and five mirnas mir124 mir32 mir574 5p mir744 and mir96 were downregulated . accumulating evidence have shown that mirnas can regulate cancer cell apoptosis by targeting bcl2 family or other apoptosis regulators figure 1 . during tumor progression the genes involved in cell cycle control often have aberrant expression resulting in unlimited tumor cell growth . since let7 regulates hmga2 expression in pituitary adenomas let7 may also take a role in pituitary adenoma invasion . identified 17 mirnas which were differentially expressed in gh secreting pituitary tumors .", ". through the personal profiles of altmetrics for each member of the simpar group we were able to count the number of

is not clear but they likely contribute to the evolution of diversity in crispr cas systems and explain why many microorganisms have several different systems . in the many hundreds of articles since published detailed molecular understanding of the crispr cas systems have been generated how the system learns to recognize new viruses which the components of the systems are and how they are produced how the virus is recognized and destroyed what countermeasures the viruses use and which non immunity processes crispr cas components participate in . another study on the same species demonstrated that in addition to the expected competition between crispr cas immunity and phage escape mutants there were some unanticipated results phages could establish themselves in a culture containing one but not 2 spacers targeting it bacteria without crispr cas immunity persist in cultures despite presence of a large amount of phage and bacteria with 2 spacers targeting a phage could still not establish themselves in a population of phage sensitive bacteria . could the phage onslaught result in a diversity of crispr cas immunity sufficient to over power escape phage development the teams set up a study to examine the relationship between crispr diversity and the systems effectiveness by mixing and infecting cultures consisting of different number of clonal strains where each strain had a different spacer matching the phage but were otherwise identical . the authors conclude that for a full understanding of the interaction of phage and their host bacteria a model beyond a simple iterative process of crispr cas immunity and phages escaping it is needed . microorganisms contain a variety of innate defense mechanisms such as preventing dna injection cleaving certain sequences using restriction modification systems preventing phage proliferation by bacteriophage exclusion and even committing altruistic suicide by abortive infection systems to prevent viruses to spread in a population . by following the bacteria phage co evolution in the population it was clear that crispr spacer diversification and phage evolution was very quick and it was also discovered that certain regions of the phage genome were preferred as targets for the crispr cas system . the ability of a population with high diversity in crispr cas immunity to successful protect themselves from viral escape mutants may be a selection pressure driving the evolution of other anti crispr strategies . indeed a dms3vir phage encoding an anti crispr protein affected high diversity crispr populations in the same manner as crispr monocultures demonstrating that the usefulness of crispr cas immunity is basically nullified . the presence of an adaptive immune system in microorganisms was unanticipated when what is now known as the crispr cas systems were suggested in 2005 and subsequently demonstrated in 2007 .", "the air was evacuated and replaced with n2 . the air was evacuated and

images . we present here the first case of primary yst arising in the pancreas with hepatic metastasis in an adult woman . to the best of our knowledge there has been no report about primary yst arising in the pancreas and especially occurring in a 57year old woman . in the present case the non contrast ct scan showed an oval shaped heterogeneous soft tissue mass with a central hypodense area and the mass displayed moderate inhomogeneous enhancement . since pancreatic cancer is sometimes associated with an elevated afp level although not so high as in this patient and more often the hepatic metastases an initial diagnosis of conventional pancreatic adenocarcinoma was made . in a previous case report this tumor was usually described as a large multi lobulated solid heterogeneous hypodense mass that showed moderate and heterogeneous enhancement 7 . because of the extreme rarity of primary yst of the pancreas metastatic germ cell tumor from the gonads or other primary or

and contrary to the thickened synovium the effusion in the articular cavities sheaths and bursae results from the malfunction of the synovial membrane which is affected by inflammation . as a result we will observe the classical image of the rheumatoid hand deformed by the disease more and more rarely . in the case of a complete rupture prior to a planned surgery it is essential to determine the distance between the stumps and their morphological condition . active tendovaginitis with tendinitis of the extensor carpi ulnaris in us examination one may observe anomalous joint position which may

between onset of rd and surgery was 17.7 24.9 days . for this present analysis only patients with a macula on rd at the time of the surgery and the macula on during the entire follow up were included . the mean time between onset of rd signs or symptoms and surgery was 13.3 24.9 days although all patients were macula on at the time of surgery . in addition photopsias could appear several days or even weeks before the development of rd . in g2 table 1 which included phakic and pseudophakic eyes with reattached retinas and visual loss the final va 0.23 0.14 was lower than the initial va 0.65 0.25 p 0.0001 paired t test despite reattachment of the retina . for rd certain variables are thought to be significant predictors for functional outcome for instance the status of the macula which is the most important factor macular elevation when detached and other factors such as age of the patient 9 25 poor initial vision 9 25 and interval between onset of rd and surgery 23 2729 . group 2 g2 n 53 included macula on patients with reattached retina and who experienced visual loss at the third month of follow up . while there are published data regarding the improvement of anatomical results of rd surgery there are few reports showing whether or not rd surgery results in functional improvement 911 13 14 23 24 and to the best of our knowledge there is only a report regarding visual loss in macula on rd after successful surgery . statistical analysis was conducted with spss v.19 spss chicago il usa and r software . first is that the study design was not intended to solve the question of vision loss in patients with macula on rd but in view of the lack of reports on va loss after macula on rd surgery we have considered that our data could be interesting . and there are few papers dealing with this topic . comparing the preoperative characteristics of the overall study patients the g1 patients all of whom were in the macula on group were statistically different for the following table 2 . however we have experienced macula on rd cases in which despite successful surgery the visual results were not favorable . it is possible that systematic analysis of the status of the macula by oct may increase the number of macula off patients and also that structural changes in patients with visual loss could be detected . the preoperative va in g1 was 20100 in 44 patients

for the functional outcome after rd surgery . the purpose of this report is to analyze those macula on rd cases that were anatomical successful treated but experienced loss of vision at the third month of follow up . the risk of rd is 4 times higher in patients who have undergone cataract surgery 5 6 . it is generally assumed by most surgeons that the macula on status before surgery guarantees good functional results which in most cases means to preserve the patients previous va . in this study 53 out of 357 patients 14.9 95ci 11.419.1 meeting the inclusion criteria experienced a worsening of va after rd surgery although the macula was attached . even in a successful rd surgery with a clinically normal macular area poor visual acuity va color vision defects and metamorphopsia have been described in successful postoperative rd macula on surgeries suggesting the existence of microstructural retina damage . in 12 eyes the central retina was not reattached therefore they were excluded from further analysis . however no postsurgical rise in iop was detected in this series and no one received silicon oil tamponade in these groups so these variables can be safely excluded as the cause of visual loss in our patients . in g1 345 eyes 96.6 95ci 9498.2 had reattached retinas at the end of follow up . 4 eyes without myopia were less frequent in g1 . the main preoperative characteristics of this group were the following 1 no pvr was present in 48.7 whereas pvr grades a and b were present in 33.3 and 17.9 respectively 2 a visible retinal tear and a unique break were present in 97.4 and

diclofenac induces a decrease in sod2 protein level and an increase of the ros concentration . in particular the detection of cytochrome c was carried out on both cytosolic and mitochondrial protein fractions from sh sy5y cells incubated in the absence or in the presence of 150 m of diclofenac at different times figure 9 . to evaluate whether diclofenac had cytotoxic effects on neuronal cells the human neuroblastoma cell line sh sy5y was incubated for 24 hours with increasing concentrations of diclofenac . when sh sy5y cells were treated with 150 m diclofenac the sod2 protein level was significantly reduced . to investigate the possibility that the reduction of the sod2 protein levels corresponded also to a decrease in sod activity the protein extracts obtained from cells incubated with 150 m diclofenac were analysed at different times using a sod activity gel which allows the detection of the activity of both mitochondrial sod2 and cytosolic sod1 . to this aim the dose and time dependent effects of this drug on sod2 protein levels of sh sy5y cells were analysed in the experiments reported in figure 3 . when these neuronal cells were incubated for 24 hours with increasing diclofenac concentrations a dose dependent decrease of the sod2 protein level was observed as evaluated by western blotting using antibodies against human sod2 figure 3a . the increased ros level the low functionality of the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme sod2 together with a partial recovery of sod2 properties by a heterelogous thioredoxin strongly suggest the involvement of mitochondria in the diclofenac induced apoptosis of sh sy5y cells . to analyse the time dependent increase of apoptosis sh sy5y cells were exposed to 150 m diclofenac and analysed at different times . to this aim sh sy5y cells were incubated in the presence or in the absence of 150 m diclofenac for 4 8 and 24 hours . a similar picture emerged when sh sy5y cells were incubated with 150 m diclofenac and analysed at different times . in this paper we have investigated the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in the mechanism of diclofenac induced apoptosis in the neuroblastoma cell line sh sy5y . here we show that diclofenac induces apoptosis of sh sy5y cells in a time and concentration dependent manner thus suggesting that this compound is somehow toxic even for a neuronal type cell . our data on sh sy5y cells show that diclofenac impairs sod2 functions thus suggesting that this enzyme is involved in the apoptotic mechanism induced by the drug . as sod2 is the primary antioxidant enzyme in mitochondria protecting cells from oxidative injuries we have evaluated the role exerted by this enzyme in sh sy5y cells in the course of diclofenac treatment . sh sy5y cells were plated at a density of 3 10 cells well in 6well plates and 150 m diclofenac was added to the cultures . as shown in figure 8 the mitochondrial incorporation of r123 in sh sy5y cells treated with 150 m diclofenac underwent a significant reduction compared to that measured on untreated cells . to this aim we have assayed the ldh activity in the culture media of sh sy5y cells incubated up to 48 hours with increasing concentrations of diclofenac . these data indicate that cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria as a consequence of the diclofenac treatment of sh sy5y cells . in this paper we describe the effects of diclofenac on cultures of the neuroblastoma cell line sh sy5y thus extending to this neuronal cell our knowledge on the possible toxicity of this drug already reported for gastric hepatic or renal cells .", ". . nevertheless it is necessary to note the origin of marketed fish in order to evaluate the potential risk to the consumer . the intensification of production and

and 25 of deaths in developing countries . this study was conducted to investigate the following hypotheses and questions 1 does cold gel pack reduce the pain associated with deep breathing and coughing db and c after cardiac surgery 2 what sensations do patients have during the application of cold gel packs over sternal incision dressing 3 do patients undergoing open heart surgery prefer cold therapy prior to db and c this study was a randomized controlled trial rct with crossover design which was conducted in the cardiac surgery intensive care unit icu at a university affiliated hospital in urmia iran . means and standard deviations of pain intensity scores pre and post db and c interactions between intervention session and time found with rm anova at the first time of applying cold gel pack 48 96 patients reported feeling coolness and 2 4 patients felt numbness and at the second time of applying cold gel pack 37 74 patients reported feeling coolness and 4 8 patients felt cold 9 18 experienced numbness and no one experienced tingling . the crossover design allows each subject to serve as his her own control so we can effectively remove subject to subject variation from our investigation of the relative effect of treatment and this reduces variability and directly increases power . patients in this study reported their pain as moderate m 3.8110 when using the gel pack as compared to severe pain m 6.1810 reported without the gel pack . application of cold gel pack was effective for reducing incisional pain associated with db and c in cardiac surgery patients . the following open ended questions were asked every 5 min during each session of using cold gel pack to assess patients perception of cold therapy how does the gel pack feel on your chest can you describe the sensation to me to assess their preferences about cold therapy the following questions were asked at the end of the fourth session do you prefer cold therapy prior to dbandc data collection instruments used in this research were as follows a patient profile form that had been specifically designed for the study was completed by the patients . all patients performed four episodes of dbandc two with cold gel pack and two without it every 2 h. the seqence of gel pack application was randomized so that half of the patients were given gel pack for 15 min followed by a period of no treatment so called washout period and then they were not given gel pack . the interaction between intervention and time was significant p 0.001 table 2 and indicated that the pain scores after db and c were significantly lower when patients used the gel pack . pain scores after db and c were on average 6.1810 without gel pack compared to 3.8110 with gel pack . during the fifteen minutes15 min of gel pack application the patients were asked to describe the sensation he shethey felt during gel pack application . feeling of coolness was the most prevalent sensation during the application of the cold gel pack . the results of this study showed that cold therapy is an effective method for management of sternal incision pain associated with dbandc in cardiac surgery patients . there were 50 patients 35 males and 15 females recruited for this study from post cardiac surgery icu and no side effects or complications due to the cold therapy via gel pack were reported . patients were randomly allocated to begin the db and c sessions either with the gel pack or without the gel pack . both superficial and deep temperature changes depend on the method of cold application so future studies could also probe for more information about the effects of different temperatures time periods and ways of cold application e.g.", "2 . these patients reported short pain

demonstrates restricted water motion in the lesion shown in a indicating recent infarctionfig . gabapentin might be an effective drug for symptomatic tn related to a lateral medullary infarction . in fitzek s clinical series of wallenberg s syndrome patients with facial pain had lesions covering the trigeminal spinal tract and nucleus at the lower medulla as demonstrated by mri . therefore wallenberg syndrome is a typical cause of central post stroke pain and this pain may occasionally take the attributes of a symptomatic tn . three trials including a total of 19 patients with multiple sclerosis have reported an effect of gabapentin alone or associated with carbamazepine . the painful paroxysms were brief and intense fulfilling ichd ii diagnostic criteria for symptomatic tn . facial pain may be a feature of wallenberg s lateral medullary syndrome along with a decrease of pain and temperature sensation of the face . the somatotopic arrangement of trigeminal fibers may possibly account for these topographical differences between tn due to nerve root compression and tn due to a lateral medullary infarction . in fact gabapentin pregabalin or amitriptyline are currently recommended for first line treatment in central neuropathic pain . our patient also had neuralgiform pain attacks in association with a wallenberg s syndrome . the existing studies all deal with tn

misfolded state by themselves which will eventually act as a seed in the nucleation dependent aggregation process as seen for reported mutant syn proteins . the most frequent dna lesion generated by oxidative stress is 8oxo78dihydroguanine 8oxodg the oxidized form of guanine often associated with neurodegenerative diseases including pd and alzheimer s disease ad . together we propose a hypothetical model by which 8oxodg lesions in the protein coding region of snca could yield a small amount of tm protein species with higher aggregation propensity that potentially serve as a seeding for accelerating the aggregation of wild type syn leading to the self propagation of aggregates and causing degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway in pd figure 5 . 8oxodg the most frequent dna lesion caused by oxidative stress is often associated with neurodegenerative diseases including pd . the defense machinery refers to the antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase glutathione peroxidase glutathione reductase and catalase among many others whose primary function is to scavenge ros generated in the cells . if the 8oxodg mediated tm mutant species are more stable in the sheet form then a limited amount of tm species could be enough to promote prion like nucleation of syn . since a significant increase of 8oxodg was observed in the substantia nigra of patients with pd it is highly possible that tm event might significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of pd . as shown in syn a53 t mutant species that was reported in the familial form of pd the pathologically misfolded proteins drive the template directed misfolding of the native monomeric proteins which contributes to the nucleation dependent fibrillation process . immunocytochemical analysis of 8oxodg revealed a significant increase of this dna oxidation marker in the substantia nigra of patients with pd although the extent of nuclear 8oxodg accumulation is not as high as mitochondrial 8oxodg . together these evidences strongly suggest that oxidative stress mediated damage to cellular macromolecules including dna coupled with inefficient repair leads to progressive neurodegeneration as seen in ad pd als and others . in addition increased levels of oxidative damage to dna and rna bases have been consistent with the neurodegenerative conditions like pd ad and als .", "we examined the effects of pilates exercise training on static and dynamic balance in patients with chronic stroke . therefore the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of an 8week mat based pilates exercise training program on the static and dynamic balance abilities of patients with chronic stroke . this study proved that an 8week pilates training program improved the static and dynamic balance of patients with chronic stroke . to our knowledge this is the first study using pilates training as an intervention to improve static and dynamic balance in patients with chronic stroke . in our study the improvement in static balance was attributed to the 8week pilates training course that improved muscle control of the deeper abdominal muscles i.e. however as a result of this study the 8week pilates training program has been proven fully effective for the treatment of static and dynamic balance in patients with chronic stroke . as pilates training for patients with chronic stroke has not been reported this study could only be compared to studies of pilates training for the elderly . to measure dynamic balance participants were asked to walk on the instrumented treadmill at their self selected velocity . to verify the effects of the 8week pilates training course on the static and dynamic balance of patients with chronic stroke two data collection protocols were conducted one week before and after the training . a recent study on balance and pilates demonstrated that pilates can be effective for enhancing both static and dynamic equilibrium capacity in university students in a 16week mat exercise course13 . given these results pilates training should be considered as a rehabilitation intervention for balance improvement in patients with chronic stroke . means significant difference

associated with assisted reproductive technology . whereas the incidence has increased from 1 in 10000 50000 spontaneous pregnancies with assisted reproductive technology procedures the incidence is up to 1 a 70fold increased risk . although a general treatment strategy can not be suggested because of the small number of cases complete removal of the cervical conception should be considered for a successful pregnancy outcome . if chorionic tissue remains in the cervix bleeding cervical mass infection that could cause intrauterine infection premature rupture of the membrane and postpartum bleeding can sometimes occur and placenta accreta remains a risk because of the possibility of chorionic infiltration to the cervix . although several cases have been managed by kcl injection there is a possibility of major bleeding because of the remaining products of conception . in fact the complication of the other one case was placenta abruption which might not have been associated with remnant chorionic tissue in the cervix .", ". . . . half of the surveyed population were engaged in weight control practices 43.3 of the respondents reported trying to lose weight while 6.7 reported that they were engaged in weight gain activities . teenagers who perceived themselves as overweight engaged in weight reducing activities and exercise and reducing fat intake which were the two most commonly reported methods for weightloss in both genders . healthy or overweight individuals who perceive themselves as overweight or fat are more likely to engage in weight reduction activities whereas individuals with an excess body weight who do not perceive themselves overweight will not involve themselves in weight loss behaviours 11 12 . skipping meal 11.5 and fasting 5.1 however only 4.8 of those who reported having recourse to exercise to lose weight were achieving the recommended daily one hour of physical activity and 3.5 of those who reported increasing fruits and vegetables were actually meeting the minimum 3 servings of vegetables and 2 servings of fruits per day . in light of the high prevalence of body weight misperception existing among the teenagers and the fact that body weight perception motivated weight control behaviours promotion of healthy body image perception and healthy eating by schools and health organisations is important . body weight perception question was adapted from brener et al . to achieve their ideal teenagers engage in weight control behaviours . a large proportion 88.5 of teenagers engaged in weight reduction activities perceived themselves as overweight even though only 19.2 of them actually have a bmi above the 85th percentile on the growth chart . the current study demonstrated a similar scenario as no difference was observed in breakfast consumption between weight loss and nonweight loss adolescents . studies demonstrated that body weight perception tends to be inaccurate when compared to bmi 12 13 . research evidence support that female adolescents are more likely to diet and engage in unhealthy weight loss behaviours more frequently than males . the result of the study showed that appearance and health were the two most cited weight concerns 55.6 respondents reported appearance and 43.3 reported health . consistent with other studies the outcome of this survey indicated that body weight exaggeration was more prevalent in girls than boys . a meagre 1.7 of the population sampled were consuming 5 servings of fruits and vegetables every day . there was a considerable correlation between body weight perception and weight control activities such that 88.5 of those involved in weight loss behaviours overestimate their body weight . the list for weight control practices included exercise reducing fat consumption reducing number of snacks eaten in between meal increasing fruits and vegetable consumption consuming a balanced diet reducing the amount of food eaten at meal time skipping meal and fasting . results herein indicate a similar pattern with an overall response rate of 6.1 meeting the international recommendations for physical activity . one major limitation in this study is sample size which may not be representative of all teenagers . among the students who were involved in weight control the prevalence of weight loss practices was higher among girls 61.1 girls versus 25.6 boys . anthropometric measurements included weight and height and were measured as described by tiwari and sankhala .", "this study involved a secondary data analysis of a large national representative survey specifically the canadian community health survey cchs 2007 2008 to answer the following main research question how well do the national correction equations correct self reported estimates of obesity in atlantic canada and is there a significant difference between atlantic canadian and national correction equations in yielding corrected obesity estimates that are closer to measured data as compared to self reported values the study was approved by the interdisciplinary committee on ethics in human research at memorial university . in particular given the nature of bmi correction equations we recommend that canadian researchers use the national correction equations in the absence of measured data or compute their own correction equations if they have measured and self reported obesity data . as direct bmi measurements which are the gold standard for bmi data are an expensive method of data collection researchers have recently developed and recommended the use of correction equations based on measured data to correct self reported values 7 1015 . both correction equations significantly improved the accuracy of self reported atlantic canadian obesity data . the application of the national correction equations should strengthen research conducted with self reported atlantic canadian obesity data . the national equations could be used in future analyses of self reported bmi data from the cchs in any or all of the four atlantic provinces . the purpose of this study was to determine whether correction equations developed for the canadian population were appropriate for use in atlantic canada and to compare the accuracy of the national equations to equations that were developed specifically for the atlantic canadian population . the correction equations for the atlantic region were males bmi corrected 1.36 1.09bmi reported females bmi corrected 1.71 .98bmi reported . therefore although connor gorber and colleagues 7 15 generated correction equations in 2008 for canadians in general and reassessed them in 2011 given that they are population specific they may not hold in atypical regions of canada such as atlantic canada which has unique sociodemographic characteristics and the highest obesity rates in the country . for both equations among men who were underweight or normal weight both self reported and corrected bmi means were not significantly different than their measured counterpart . in light of reports that self reported bmi statistics underestimate the prevalence of obesity and overestimate associations between obesity and chronic diseases 7 8 23 we strongly recommend the use of correction equations to other researchers analysing obesity data collected by self report . atlantic correction equations were developed in the mhw subsample . mean bmi values based on self reported height and weight data were significantly lower p .0001 than those based on measurements for both sexes . we used the following health canada bmi categories underweight bmi 18.5 normal weight bmi 18.524.9 overweight bmi 25.029.9 obese bmi 30 . table 1 shows the sociodemographic characteristics of the 2007 2008 cchs respondents from atlantic canada as compared to those from other regions of canada . the results of the current study suggest that the national equations which are starting to be used elsewhere in the country are generalizable even to atypical regions of canada .", "3 . however in the case of yasuda et al.5 which showed a poor prognosis the lesion encroached the retrosplenium more posteriorly although the size and location of the cerebral infarction were similar to those in our case . figure 2a shows that the cerebral infarction was restricted to the left splenium with a little area of the retrosplenium . we considered that the amnesia of our patient was due to the retrosplenial lesion because memory related structures other than the retrosplenium were intact . 2a and 2b revealed a high signal intensity lesion in the left splenium and retrosplenium that appeared as a low intensity signal on the apparent diffusion coefficient adc map of b 1000 values . five days later his memory appeared to have recovered considerably but he still could not remember his home address . in contrast there are reported cases of a single right retrosplenial lesion causing both visual and verbal memory deficits.5 there is strong evidence that the right medial temporal lobe is involved in navigation and it now appears that input of the hippocampus and related structures receive from and convey to the right retrosplenial cortex has a similar spatial preference while the left medial temporal and left retrosplenial cortices appear primarily concerned with more general aspects of episodic memory.346 however there are recent studies that can explain the presence of both visual and verbal amnesias in our case .", ". . por conta de o aqlq ter sido aplicado em um nico

patients in group a rather than pgs may reflect prognosis and should be considered as one of the important prognostic factors together with pathological stage . according to the 2005 international society of urological pathology isup consensus on gleason grading of prostatic carcinoma 8 bgs was defined as summation of primary gs and highest grade gs of all biopsy cores and pgs was defined as summation of primary and secondary gs in the prostate specimen . in an extended study with 155 tumors from 61 whole mounted radical prostatectomy samples 15 of tumors included three or more histological grades 13 . one of the reasons of this discrepancy between bgs and pgs may be sampling error in biopsy of heterogenic and multicentric prostate cancer 10 . according to the difference between bgs and pgs the patients were divided into three groups group a decreased in pgs by 2 or more group b as a control group changed in pgs within 1 point and group c increased in pgs by 2 or more . all the pathologic slides of 18gauge needle biopsy and the surgical prostate specimen from the involved medical centers were reevaluated by single expert uropathologist . in a study analyzing 101 completely sectioned whole mounted radical prostatectomy samples the average number of different grades was 2.7 range 1 5 12 .", "to assess the agreement between sputum and nasopharyngeal bacterial

bp at age 81 correlated with values of abpm mainly clinic dbp high values which were reflected by higher daytime and nighttime sbp dbp sd sbp and pre and postawakening sbp as well as daytime pp . when hypertension was defined with the same criteria at age 81 table 2 left columns the values of abpm examined the same year differed between the groups and presented in hypertensive subjects higher daytime sbp and pp and higher nocturnal sbp and pp and higher pre and postawakening sbp but we have previously shown that blood pressure dynamics differed in these study subjects during the followup . the time course of abi between age 68 and 82 showed that the largest abi decline was reflected by higher daytime and nighttime systolic variability that is sd sbp and by higher pp as well as by higher pre and postawakening sbp levels but not by daytime or nighttime sbp dbp levels at age 82 . daytime values of the irish study were similar to this study in the sample at age 4049 y. compared to uruguayan population sample of men untreated for hypertension at age 70 y subjects of this study had lower mean daytime sbp with 3 mmhg dbp with 5 mmhg and mean nighttime sbp with 3 mmhg but similar nighttime dbp . at age 81 subjects defined as hypertensive expressed higher nighttime and daytime sbp post and preawakening sbp and above all higher pp . carotid stenosis correlated positively with nocturnal and preawakening sbp and daytime pp but not with daytime sbp or dbp values . all underwent medical examination including hachinski ischemic score . in a population study from denmark compared to the subgroup at age 7079 y subjects of this study had lower daytime sbp with mean 7 mmhg daytime dbp with 3 mmhg higher nighttime sbp with 3 mmhg and lower dbp with 2 mmhg . values of abpm that is daytime and nighttime sbp dbp systolic and diastolic variability mean sd sbp and sd dbp nocturnal sbp fall morning sbp surge preawakening sbp and postawakening sbp are presented in table 1 . at age 82 the cbp correlated positively with daytime sbp sd sbp dbp and pp and with nighttime sbp dbp and pp as well as with pre and postawakening sbp table 5 . compared to the subgroup at age 5059 y subjects of this study had lower daytime sbp with mean 3 mmhg daytime dbp with 5 mmhg higher nighttime sbp with 6 mmhg and lower dbp with 2 mmhg . compared to the oldest sample of population based study from dublin ireland age 5079 y subjects of this study had lower daytime sbp with 2 mmhg daytime dbp with 4 mmhg higher nighttime sbp with 7 mmhg and equal mean nighttime dbp . compared to the

6069 y subjects of this study had similar daytime and nighttime sbp but lower daytime dbp with 7 mmhg and nighttime dbp with 3 mmhg . similarly lower abi level at age 68 predicted higher daytime sbp variability and pp and not the absolute abpm values . ankle brachial index was lowest in subjects with higher nocturnal sbp pp sbp variability and preawakening sbp . compared to 15year younger japanese population based sample of ohasama study mean age 66.7 y subjects of this study had similar daytime sbp and dbp but higher nighttime sbp with mean 5 mmhg . this age related threshold of abpm values could be supported by our observation that the higher level of office bp or suffering from hypertension at age 68 did not predict higher abpm neither daytime nor nighttime at age 82 . by analyzing abpm values in hypertensive and normotensive subjects at age 82 we could conclude that low values of abpm in the whole cohort were partly due to low abpm values in those men who were hypertensive at age 68 and at the same time developed decline of clinic bp until their 80ties . abpm could also adequately express the grade of atherosclerotic process at age 82 by higher nighttime and preawakening bp levels higher nighttime bp variability and pp values in those men who had higher grade of carotid stenosis lower abi and extended abi decline during the 14year followup .", ".

pcr of 9.16 the most difficult steps were phacoemulsification of the nucleus and capsulorhexis.16 the steps considered most challenging that carried the greatest risks were emulsification of the nucleus and cortex aspiration . the decreased incidence of pcr could be due to the trainer surgeons performing the initial steps e.g. of 15 cases of pcr with the reverse training method pcr occurred during nucleus fragmentation emulsification and cortical aspiration in 4 1.2 cases each . the reverse training method resulted in almost a third lower incidence of pcr in beginner group compared to

study examined the memory performance of individuals with early ad and older adult controls on an instruction task that required the temporary storage in wm and subsequent recall of action object

including visual spatial and motoric information or specifically the impact of increased motor coding . this benefit might reflect a development of a richer set of representations supporting performance including visual spatial and motoric information or specifically the impact of increased motor coding . this revealed a main effect of group f127 14.16 p 0.001 and p 0.34 such that older adult control participants recalled significantly more elements from the action object instruction sequences than did ad patients . there was no significant interaction between encoding condition and group f127 2.67 p 0.11 and p 0.09 though the effects of spt were slightly larger in the older adult group . the primary focus of the present study was to establish whether the wm performance of ad patients would benefit from self enactment at encoding . the performance of actions was self paced in the spt condition and a two second delay separated verbal presentation of each action object pair in the vt condition to control for this . in order to explore the group length interaction data was collapsed across encoding condition and paired samples t tests indicated that increasing sequence length had a greater effect on the recall performance of older adult controls than it did on ad participants t29 7.08 p 0.001 and d 1.38 and t27 2.95 p 0.006 and d 0.56 respectively . in contrast the most recent study to investigate the enactment effect in mild ad patients demonstrated superior recall for spt relative to verbal only encoding tasks in free recall as well as in semantic cued recall and object cued recall . a main effect of encoding condition was also found f1 27 46.71 p 0.001 and p 0.63 and this was in the direction predicted as recall was significantly higher in the spt condition compared with the vt condition across group and sequence length . this study considered the usefulness of the subject performed task spt manipulation in improving wm in early ad and healthy older adult controls in a task measuring the ability to verbally repeat short sequences of instructions . the findings reveal that verbal recall in both older adults and individuals with ad was significantly facilitated by the performance of actions on objects at encoding . as the instruction task has been shown to rely heavily on wm abilities and because patients with early ad have wm deficits we predicted that this group would perform poorer relative to an older adult control group . in the spt condition each action object pair was performed by the participant immediately after verbal presentation for instance tap the yellow ruler enactment. a 2 group 2 encoding condition 2 sequence length mixed anova was performed . there was also no interaction between condition and

a 19.44 improvement in performance on the bbs and 100 improvement in performance on the mas following training using the device and interactive game . in this study the task for patients was to use cop to aim an arrow and to shoot it at a target when the sum value of the healthy side load cell is less than 20 of the value for the load cell unit as a whole red warnings were displayed on the monitor to tell the patient to move their cop to the other side . according to barclay goddard stevenson poluha et al.7 through traditional treatment stroke patients can increase standing symmetry when using a force plate for treatment . fixing the affected part and using the healthy part to complete the target movement . this means that techniques which oblige stroke patients to practice centralized postural and balance control on the affected side will have considerable impact on the stroke patients recovery of balance walking and other mobility related functions . the effect on balance performance training using the device was assessed using two patients . after training the cop distribution of patient a shifted towards the right affected side presumably because the patient habitually supported standing with the healthy side . the six distribution values are then merged to become the pressure centers of the right and left feet and the whole cop in the virtual plane of the game engine using this rule healthy side affected side 1 n n is decided by the medical staff based on the patient s diagnosed medical condition n1.5 for case a and 4 for case b in this study . patient a showed considerable improvement in static standing balance control with his eyes open . although patient a used his healthy side to support his body weight in a standing position under certain circumstances he could switch to using the affected side . however this behavior does not require postural control so nervous impulses to the affected side reduce which further hinders

study provides more details concerning the performance of some acrylic resins under abrasive load . brushing with distilled water caused minimum mass reduction confirming the results from other studies28 . artificial brushing is vigorous and may be more abrasive than manual brushing19 but some works have shown similar results between laboratory and clinical experiments2021 . based on the obtained results and within the limitations of an in vitro study it may be concluded that differences exist among heat polymerized acrylic resins concerning abrasion resistance and that dentifrices specific for denture cleansing tend to cause less damage to acrylic resin surface . due to the experimental conditions of this study sexson and phillips27 showed that mass reduction obtained from brushing rotating acrylic resin specimens was similar to that produced when specimens were allowed to remain stationary although microscopic examination revealed that the rotating specimens had different surface topography . plexiglas patterns 90x30x3 mm were included into investment flasks no . the acrylic resins and dentifrices used in this study are presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively . it is thus important to evaluate the abrasion resistance to brushing of heat polymerized acrylic resins used for fabrication of denture bases . according to the tukey s test for mass loss mg of acrylic resins and dentifrices the resins qc20 and lucitone 550 showed greater mass reduction which indicated lower abrasion resistance as compared to the other resins . the acrylic resin hardness the type of abrasive agent and its concentration the dimension and form of abrasive particles the toothbrush and the load applied are some of the different factors that influence the abrasion of acrylic resin by brushing4712 . hence surface roughness and brightness loss would not provide results valid for this study in which the specimens remained stationary . abrasion caused by brushing of acrylic resin denture bases polymerized by different methods may result in mass loss surface roughness loss of surface polishing problems on denture adaptation due the loss of surface details and difficulty on the maintenance of denture hygiene7212227 . the aim of this study was to evaluate the mass loss of four commercially available heat polymerized acrylic resins after simulated toothbrushing with three different dentifrices . for this reason the specimens were stored in water at 37c for 7 days before the test in order to balance water sorption17 . the mechanical removal of debris with the use of toothbrush dentifrice and water is a popular cleansing technique used by great part of denture wearers7 . prior to simulated toothbrushing the specimens were removed from the

ap dkk1 cm diluted in cell culture medium for 2 hours at 4c . for nci8642 binding and kinetic assays the compound was diluted in hbs ep buffer at concentration ranging from 3 to 50 m and injected over lrp6 surface for 60 sec at the flow rate of 30 l min . we also analyzed the effect of nci8642 on the binding of dkk1 to lrp6 to determine whether the compound could interfere with the interaction between dkk1 and lrp6 . for the quantitative ap dkk1 binding assay ap dkk1 cm was diluted to obtain a phosphatase activity of 20 mu ml . for inhibition analysis dkk1 54 nm diluted in hbs ep buffer ph

the concentration of 20 m figure 2emiddle and lower panels . a small molecule nci8642 has been described as an inhibitor of the interaction between dkk1 and one of its receptors lrp5 as well as an inhibitor of dkk1 activity in reducing wntcatenin signaling activation . when immobilized on the sensor chip dkk1 lost the ability to bind lrp6 suggesting that the immobilization caused a modification of dkk1 structure function thus the direct interaction of nci8642 to dkk1 was not measured . we injected dkk1 and nci8642 over lrp6 previously immobilized . in order to determine if nci8642 was also

supporting our hypothesis that mld can attenuate frontal eeg asymmetry . therefore the present preliminary study investigated the effects of mld in subjects with psychological stress and greater relative right frontal eeg activation with mld expected to shift eeg patterns toward symmetry . in conclusion our preliminary study showed that mld can significantly increase left sided anterior activation . mld application acts as a very light stimulator against psychological stress we predicted that mld would be associated with frontal eeg asymmetry and state and specifically result in greater left frontal hemisphere activation in the alpha frequency band . in this preliminary study frontal lobe eeg activity patterns in response to mld of the neck were examined to better understand alpha wave processing in subjects with psychological stress . as alpha power is inversely associated with cortical activation a negative asymmetry score which denotes greater alpha activity on the left and less alpha power on the right would suggest greater right sided activation . statistical analysis comparing pre and post mld asymmetry values in channels f7f8 showed a statistically significant increase in hemispheric asymmetry fp1fp2 p 0.082 f3f4 p 0.065 and f7f8 p 0.032 . participants were then asked to close their eyes and refrain from talking falling asleep or making exaggerated body movements in order to observe the cortical electrical activity without any external stimuli minimizing possible visual artifacts during eeg measurement . recent studies have suggested that greater left sided anterior activation indexed by decreased alpha activity in the left hemisphere is associated with a higher degree of positive affectivity a feeling of well being and a reduction in anxiety28 32 . stimuli such as conversation phone calls and noise that could increase the activity of sentinel nodes were minimized and the subject s body was covered with a soft and thin sheet to avoid discomfort from body exposure . mld generally caused an activation shift from the right hemisphere to the left hemisphere in all frontal electrode pairs analyzed in this study . there are some studies that have investigated the effects of different manual techniques on frontal eeg activation4 5 16 17 however mld is not one of the techniques that have been investigated . eeg data

coast of south america as a ship s doctor on a vessel owned by the hamburg it is therefore more than likely that giemsa prowazek and rodenwaldt learnt of neiva s observations of quinine resistance in rio de janeiro s swampy lowlands before he systematised and published his findings in the first volume of memrias do instituto oswaldo cruz . neiva s interpretation of the situation was that the malaria haematozoon had developed resistance to quinine . during prowazek and giemsa s sojourn at the instituto oswaldo cruz the institution was also visited by ernst rodenwaldt an army physician also connected to hamburg s institute for maritime and tropical diseases . in hamburg the director of the institute for maritime and tropical diseases bernhard nocht and the head of the institute s clinical department heinrich werner would have the chance to observe resistance amongst the german workers who had been repatriated to that hanseatic city as mentioned before . if before the war neiva and werner spoke of a property developed in the parasites during the war the phenomenon started to be related to the inefficacy of the alkaloid caused by incorrect prophylaxis organic factors like immunity the social resistance of troops ascribable to the drug s side effects and so on . in his report to the company building the railway oswaldo cruz endorsed neiva s theory about the formation of quinine resistant races of the plasmodium . the study of the historical records about the resistance of the malaria parasite to quinine demonstrates how important the research into the topic was to individual careers and to the formation of collective ideas which despite being involved in international research programmes followed national styles in the way they studied and fought the disease a prototypical tropical disease according to schilling the conditions that neiva nocht werner mhlens and others have presented as being propitious for the development of quinine resistant races are valid . therefore the alterations could not be transmitted by hereditary means in a morphologically identical population of plasmodia but with a different genotypical behaviour towards quinine it is possible that quinine resistant races can be isolated by selection that is plasmodia that have the same phenotypical appearance but which behave differently towards quinine could lead to the selection of a quinine resistant race with common phenotypical and genotypical features . in a morphologically identical population of plasmodia but with a different genotypical behaviour towards quinine it is possible that quinine resistant races can be isolated by selection that is plasmodia that have the same phenotypical appearance but which behave differently towards quinine could lead to the selection of a quinine resistant race with common phenotypical and genotypical features . rodenwaldt believed that plasmodium strains that had different levels of susceptibility to quinine but the same physical features emerged spontaneously in nature . the conditions that neiva nocht werner mhlens and others have presented as being propitious for the development of quinine resistant races are valid . neiva himself upon moving away from the region and stopping taking quinine preventively was struck with a benign tertian fever at his home in rio de janeiro . according to the tropical medicine specialist ernst rodenwaldt amongst the specialists with experience of working in the tropics or on board ship the way to treat malaria was taken for granted by all. the reason nocht and werner were so surprised at the failure of quinine in patients from the madeira mamor region was simply that the treatment they had used until then had been successful . the successful campaign against yellow fever led by oswaldo cruz in rio de janeiro attracted two researchers from hamburg s institute for maritime and tropical diseases in 1904 . neiva and werner s theoretical speculations continued to be the most comprehensive attempts to explain quinine resistance even if they were riddled with inaccuracies and gaps . there the director of the instituto de manguinhos noted that huge doses of quinine up to 3 g a day still failed to prevent malaria from breaking out amongst people working on the railway . but unlike gradmann s findings concerning trypanosomes the plasmodium s resistance to quinine was closely related to the frequency with which it occurred as a clinical phenomenon . the scientific and geopolitical cartography that emerged after the second world war was a far cry from the context when neiva nocht and rodenwaldt were active in their fields . whenever quinine was taken preventively the doses used varied greatly . generally speaking i am less inclined to accept that the parasites develop hereditary resistance to quinine and deem it more likely that that there is selection and increased virulence in particularly virulent resistant strains . generally speaking i am less inclined to accept that the parasites develop hereditary resistance to quinine and deem it more likely that that there is selection and increased virulence in particularly virulent resistant strains . in november 1907 first time infections started to appear amongst people who had taken quinine preventively every two days . in an article also published in 1910 they stated that they had been prepared for some quinine resistance in the malaria contracted in inland brazil but they had been taken aback by its strength . he did not see this property as being an inheritance of acquired modifications in this case as in others it is naturally far more reasonable to concede that isolated races of malaria parasites had differing resistances to quinine and that by treating an infected person with the drug a more resistant race that already existed was simply cultivated in the pure form . certain authors suggested that many supposed cases of biological quinine resistance were not just down to human resistance and the inadequate use of the drug but also to the general state of the patients who suffered from malnutrition stress and fatigue because of the physical and emotional impact of the war . according to heiner fangerau the combination of mendel and weissmann s ideas that formed the groundwork for rodenwaldt s analyses of resistance represented a watershed for the theories of racial hygiene it becoming clear how predictable was the inheritance of isolated features. in this case as in others it is naturally far more reasonable to concede that isolated races of malaria parasites had differing resistances to quinine and that by treating an infected person with the drug a more resistant race that already existed was simply cultivated in the pure form . in the tropics selection did not take place because the native population had a degree of immunity to the disease and almost never took quinine while europeans were generally treated correctly . in a bid to make some sense of the arguments and opinions that abounded martin mayer distinguished two forms of resistance chininabstmpfung dulling or insensitivity to quinine due to factors within the patient s body that made the individual unresponsive to the alkaloid and chiningewhnung adaptation to quinine referring to what took place inside the parasite . in 1919 in the archiv fr schiffs und tropen hygiene rodenwaldt published an article about the plasmodium s resistance to quinine . as shown by christoph gradmann with regard to trypanosomes and arsenic compounds the analysis of quinine resistance on the part of the plasmodium shows that this became an object of investigation far before the phenomenon gained the full attention of the medical community because of bacterial resistance to antibiotics starting in the 1960s . for neiva the quinine the mosquito absorbed when it fed on blood was in some way implicated in the process although this is an idea that werner ruled out as he thought that the quantity of alkaloid in the blood was too small for this . rodenwaldt was not so sure of this but added that the disappearance of alterations in the malaria plasmodia was in part due to the fact that their asexual reproduction was more complex than that of trypanosomes . since the founding of the hamburg institute and the sailors hospital the disease that had been most studied and treated there had been malaria . rodenwaldt was involved in another far less gentlemanly exchange of views with another former student of the hamburg school viktor schilling who visited brazil in 1912 . even so schilling acknowledged that the way rodenwaldt had developed baur s ideas was an interesting independent theoretical accomplishment which far outstrips my scant experiences derived from practice. unlike previous experience the tropical form was more likely to relapse than the tertian forms which normally was caused by a species of plasmodium that tended to produce more obstinate relapses . rodenwaldt later tried to make selection the theoretical basis for this process exactly in the same sense i gave to him . rodenwaldt later tried to make selection the theoretical basis for this process exactly in the same sense i gave to him . the material researched for this paper is not yet enough to analyse these discussions about the problem of quinine resistant malaria in any great depth . a publication from the following year shows that he saw resistance differently from neiva and rodenwaldt which suggests that the latters hypotheses had not left the theoretical realm my personal views on the matter have always been that the apparent resistance to medicine was less a characteristic of the parasite itself or even of certain strains of parasites than of the infected individual in whom it represented a lowering of the protective powers of the organism . several colleagues wrote rodenwaldt in 1919 will still remember the time when a malaria diagnosis in the tropics or at home would somehow lift our spirits about the patient for we were certain we could help and promise a definite cure. as in the campaigns run by chagas and neiva emphasis was put on using quinine and providing protection against mosquito bites . for this reason peter mhlens head of the clinical section at the tropeninstitut recommended as neiva had in the baixada fluminense lowlands in brazil strict supervision by the sanitation officials to make sure they actually ingested the quinine . the action of quinine often left much to be desired both therapeutically and prophylactically wrote the army physician wilhelm hoffmann as he weighed up the impact of malaria on german troops . the resistance of the plasmodium to the alkaloid was cited as one of its main disadvantages . his comments only became public two years later in the archiv fr schiffs und tropen hygiene and deutsche medizinische wochenschrift at the same time that rodenwaldt was publishing his thesis . the theory of the development of quinine resistant races of the plasmodium put forward by arthur neiva would appear to be the first scientific work in the literature about malaria that attempted to give an explanation for the persistence of the disease even when the alkaloid was taken in ever higher doses . from 1921 to 1934 when he was working in dutch colonies in south east asia primarily combating malaria rodenwaldt published dozens of papers about racial hygiene or eugenics . the cases of first time infection vanished wherever quinine administration was strict but the change in dosage did not halt the rise in the number of workers who fell ill when they were away from the worksite temporarily . this dependence of the selection of quinine resistant races on the greater or lesser efficacy of therapeutic treatments explained why the problem did not occur in regions like germany where malaria had been endemic for a long time or italy which had had a systematic process for fighting the disease for some time the main consequence of treatment in a country with doctors and where the people are used to the therapy until the disease is eradicated was that the selection of quinine resistant races was prevented because the use of high doses of quinine until the parasites were killed made it impossible for epidemic levels to be reached . werner tested the preparation again on brazilian malaria but it failed to prevent relapses in any case . his involvement with the problem of quinine resistance certainly influenced the campaign strategies adopted in asia . in a third explanatory hypothesis neiva highlights the relationship between non infected individuals and victims of relapses in a situation of homogeneous chemical richness supposing that the haematozoa got accustomed to the alkaloid when they encountered it in high concentrations throughout the whole man the resistant plasmodium races were formed by their cultivation in a quinine rich environment both in man and in vectors as such growing from gametes accustomed to living in media where quinine was always present the haematozoa in another cycle from ookinete to the final feeding that released the sporozoite in the bloodstream already continued to develop even in the presence of quinine . let us turn to the testimony of ernst rodenwaldt first of all prevention seemed to fail then the cure . he chose to administer quinine preventively drain and landfill wetlands and provide collective protective measures for the workers in the form of screens in their lodgings while keeping the chronically ill in isolation and providing treatment for acute cases . he did find it to have some effect against the plasmodium but its action was very slow . the difficulty of importing it during the first world war prompted him to start quinine production at the butant institute run by the so paulo public health service . however if they were only repelled by erythrocytes argued rodenwaldt it was hard to imagine how these plasmodia would adapt to a drug that had no direct effect on them . the only safe form of treatment was then 50cg taken without the exception of even a single day. nocht felt that the inefficacy of ever larger doses of quinine was not related to the emergence of strains of quinine resistant parasites as neiva had suggested . their mission was to observe the methods used to fight the disease and to study as yet obscure aspects of its aetiology and epidemiology . there he came across a new human trypanosomiasis which was later named after him chagas disease . in his rebuttal schilling accused rodenwaldt of having appropriated his ideas which he had learnt about in smyrna a province in south western turkey where they had met in 1918 . notwithstanding the range of diseases that plagued the workers the main culprit for crippling the madeira mamor works was malaria . different theories were expounded to explain the mechanisms by which different variants and therefore new species emerged as well as the processes involved in transmitting these variations through successive generations . this seemed to work but now the disease struck those who were taking lower doses . indeed several aspects of the epidemiology and physiopathology of malaria would remain obscure . even though he no longer researched malaria it continued to be a topic of interest to him albeit now in the arena of debates and political action . chagas identified which species of anopheles were present in the region describing some that were new to science . the archiv fr schiffs und tropen hygiene naval and tropical hygiene archive frequently commented on or summarised articles published by brazilians in local or foreign journals . this war fostered appropriations of scientific ideas and actions that are not always clear or obvious . one of the people involved in marketing the new malaria drugs was peter mhlens director of the clinical section of the institute for tropical diseases in hamburg . he went on to reiterate his belief in the selection of pure lineages of already existing resistant strains in which furthermore nothing is altered there is no increase or diminishment of virulence and they do not adapt to anything at all. in a chapter on malaria in the renowned clinical medicine handbook edited by klemperer he claimed that many cases of tropical malaria caused by p. falciparum were found to be resistant to treatment using drugs because the treatment was inadequate this is why during the war and in the following years so much was said about the malaria parasites resistance to quinine. german researchers followed closely the scientific theories and innovations produced on the other side of the atlantic . the tests made by nocht and werner with methylene blue and salvarsan show that they were attuned with the chemotherapy developed by paul ehrlich and his collaborators . henrique arago and alcides godoy another researcher at the instituto oswaldo cruz both did postgraduate studies in germany in 1907 . the main consequence of treatment in a country with doctors and where the people are used to the therapy until the disease is eradicated was that the selection of quinine resistant races was prevented because the use of high doses of quinine until the parasites were killed made it impossible for epidemic levels to be reached .", ". however morris et al .", "there is only a single case report of limbal lch in which the patient remained asymptomatic for a while after complete excision of the primary lesion but the tumor recurred 15 months afterwards.27 based on clinical and histopathological evaluations the recurrent tumor partially responded to combination chemotherapy and the patient was clinically stable for 5.5 years.7 in our case recurrence developed 10 months after resection of the primary lesion for which repeat resection together with corneoscleral patch grafting were performed and the patient has been tumor free up to 4 months . electron microscopy may also assist the diagnosis by demonstrating intracytoplasmic inclusions named birbeck granules.1 the natural course of untreated lch varies from progressive and fatal systemic disease to localized self limited lesions.8 local resection for unifocal involvement and systemic chemotherapy for extensive multifocal lesions have been proposed as treatment modalities in lch9 however spontaneous regression has been reported in some unifocal lch cases.1 herein we report a case of unifocal lch presenting as an unusual limbal lesion which recurred after primary excision . unifocal involvement is the most common presentation of lch and the bone is the most frequently affected tissue.1 ocular involvement can be observed in 1 to 20 of lch cases.2 the condition may primarily involve the orbit eyelid epibulbar conjunctiva cornea iris vitreous choroid and optic nerve or secondarily infiltrate ocular tissues from surrounding structures.34 intraocular involvement by lch has rarely been reported in letterer siwe disease.5 the orbit is usually involved with unifocal lch which has a distinct tendency for the superotemporal bone at the rim of the orbit.6 the limbus can rarely be involved in unifocal lch presenting clinically as an infiltrative solitary limbal nodule which may be misdiagnosed as amyloidosis fibrous histiocytoma lymphoma and juvenile xanthogranuloma.27 the diagnosis of lch is based on characteristic histopathological features . with a clinical diagnosis of a recurrent limbocorneal papillomatous dermoid like lesion the

delays in the majority of the patients in previous phase ii and iii clinical trials table 3.4547 the pattern of disease progression in radioiodine refractory thyroid tumor should also be considered at the time of therapy initiation median pfs in placebo treated groups range from 3.65.8 months to the extent that asymptomatic patients may take months to meet criteria for disease progression . there were three deaths due to aes including respiratory arrest not otherwise specified respiratory failure and paraneoplastic syndrome not specified only the respiratory failure related death was deemed to be treatment related by the treating physicians.46 in the seminal phase iii study select a total of 392 patients with radioactive iodine resistant progressive thyroid carcinomas of follicular origin defined as progression within the previous 13 months according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors the presence of one measurable lesion without radioiodine uptake on any iodine scan or disease progression within 12 months of radioiodine therapy were randomized to either lenvatinib n261 or placebo n131.47 a significant improvement in the median pfs the primary end point was documented among patients treated with lenvatinib compared to placebo 18.3 vs 3.6 months hr 0.21 99 ci 0.140.31 p0.001 with an unprecedented response rate of 64.8 . taking into account all of the caveats inherent to cross trial comparisons the us fda approved the tki sorafenib based on the results of the decision trial which showed a pfs of 10.8 months in the sorafenib arm vs 5.8 months in the placebo arm hr 0.59 95 ci 0.450.76 p0.0001 and an orr of 12.2.27 by contrast lenvatinib treated patients derived a greater benefit from this tki compared to placebo in the select trial as reflected by a pfs of 18.3 months vs 3.6 months hr 0.21 99 ci 0.140.31 p0.001 and an orr of 64.8.47 both these trials included similar patient populations but the decision trial excluded patients with previous tki exposure . interestingly the benefit of lenvatinib was independent of the braf and ras mutational status of the tumor on a preplanned subgroup analysis in select.47 this could be due to the wide range of tumor cell targets affected by lenvatinib or its ability to target unique molecules such as the fgfr.19 the angiogenesis of mtc a highly vascular tumor is mediated principally by vegf fgf pdgf and their respective receptors.62 overexpression of vegf and vegfr2 has been observed in 5095 of mtc tumors and is associated with metastases.6365 in the aforementioned phase ii trial of lenvatinib for the treatment of 59 patients with advanced mtc in which circulating cytokine and angiogenic factors levels were collected from 51 patients after 8 days of therapy high baseline levels of vegf soluble vegfr3 and pdgf and low baseline levels of soluble tie2 were associated with tumor reduction . of note hypertension was the most common grade 3 or higher toxicity affecting 42 of the patients in the select trial while observed in only 710 of the patients in the phase ii trials.4546 all grade hypertension occurred in up to 67 of the patients treated with lenvatinib select and it led to dose reductions or interruptions in up to 20 of the patients . in the expanded mtd cohort of 25 mg n24 grade 3 hypertension occurred in three 13 patients and grade 3 proteinuria in two 8 patients.44 based on these phase i trial results a subsequent phase ii trial was conducted among 58 patients with differentiated radioiodine refractory thyroid cancer who were treated with lenvatinib at 24 mg daily . in the phase iii select study gastrointestinal perforation or fistula was observed in 2 of patients receiving lenvatinib compared to 0.8 in the placebo group.52 in addition aerodigestive fistula formation had also been documented in a case report in which a patient receiving lenvatinib developed significant general decline and required percutaneous gastrostomy for nutritional support.53 radiation therapy and large thoracic tumor burden are considered risk factors for aerodigestive fistula formation associated with lenvatinib and other anti angiogenesis therapies.5455 hemorrhagic complications were also documented in the 35 of patients treated with lenvatinib in the phase iii trial compared to 18 in the placebo group . most recently a meta analysis of 24 phase ii and iii trials estimated the risk of all grade hfs at 39 for patients treated with sorafenib.29 prophylactic treatment with urea based cream can decrease the incidence of or delay the development of hfs in patients receiving sorafenib.30 another meta analysis showed that all grade diarrhea occurred in 37 of patients treated with sorafenib for different types of tumors and can negatively impact quality of life.31 in addition to sorafenib several other kinase inhibitors have been studied for the treatment of advanced follicular origin radioiodine refractory thyroid cancer table 1 . of note two patients died after serious aes one arterial hemorrhage and one cardiac arrest.45 in another cohort of patients lenvatinib was tested at the set dose of 24 mg daily in 59 patients with advanced mtc 44 of whom received prior anti vegfr therapy and 15 received prior chemotherapy.46 overall response rate orr was 36 and median pfs was 9 months . improved os was identified in patients older than 65 years median 71 years when treated with lenvatinib.67 at this juncture the antitumor activity of lenvatinib including its improvement in pfs among patients with advanced progressive thyroid carcinomas of follicular origin supports its clinical use . sorafenib is an oral tki that abrogates signaling from numerous molecules including braf ret ptc vegfr13 pdgfr and c kit.2526 the antineoplastic activity of sorafenib for the treatment of thyroid cancer was demonstrated in many trials including the decision trial which was a phase iii placebo controlled randomized study of 417 patients with progressive radioactive iodine refractory locally advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer assigned to sorafenib 400 mg twice daily or placebo.2728 the histological subtypes confirmed by a central review primarily consisted of ptc and ftc . despite the previous use of targeted therapies lenvatinib also significantly improved the pfs in this subgroup of patients 15.1 vs 3.6 months hr 0.22 95 ci 0.120.41 and increased response rates 62.1 vs. 3.7 .48 complete radiologic responses were seen in four patients and prolonged stable disease longer than 23 weeks was noted in 39 patients treated with lenvatinib . it has been suggested that aes such as worst grade proteinuria correlated with lenvatinib antitumor activity in a small phase i dose escalation clinical trial.84 to our knowledge no stratified analysis of the efficacy of lenvatinib by toxicity has been reported . these subtypes account for 9095 of all cases and are collectively referred to as differentiated thyroid cancers dtcs.3 in general these are indolent tumors associated with a favorable prognosis as reflected by long term survival rates of 90 with standard treatments of surgery and radioactive iodine therapy.4 nevertheless patients who develop recurrent or metastatic radioactive iodine refractory disease have 10year survival rates of only 1520.5 before the advent of targeted therapies chemotherapy was the only option for the treatment of patients with advanced thyroid cancer of follicular origin refractory to radioactive iodine.6 doxorubicin with its known cardiac and hematologic toxicities alone or in combination with other compounds formed the backbone of palliative therapy for such patients.78 the oncogene pathway driven approach to the understanding of the pathophysiology of thyroid cancer led to the development of clinical trials that assessed the antitumor activity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors tkis . lenvatinib is a tki that targets vegfr13 fgfr14 pdgfr ret and c kit.3235 preclinical evidence indicates that lenvatinib inhibits tumor growth tumor induced angiogenesis cell migration and invasion in various human thyroid cancer xenograft and in vitro models.3637 compared to the other multikinase inhibitors tested in patients with differentiated thyroid tumors lenvatinib is particularly active against the fgfr family of tyrosine kinase receptors table 2 . for the placebo crossover

disease processes . in many cases reanimation of such patients this conundrum is created because we must be prepared to apply life sustaining technology to patients when the benefit appears to outweigh the risk and when there is a reasonable chance for an outcome that the patient would desire . however if organ system failure is not reversible then the reasoning behind life support technology becomes moot . it frequently seems reasonable to buy sufficient time to see whether the disease will respond to aggressive treatment by instituting the most invasive life support technology . however there is a continuing trend of surrogates demanding that moribund patients be kept on life support after prevailing medical opinions concur that there is no meaningful chance of reanimation . physicians do not have an exceptional track record in explaining end of life issues to patients and their families . accordingly some families feel that if life support systems can maintain vital signs for a day or a week then suspended animation should be possible indefinitely until a cure is found . patients may be stalled in suspended animation they are not alive in the sense the we enjoy life but neither are they able to die as long as nutrition hydration ventilation and perfusion are assured . the notion of medical futility as an end stage process in which vital signs can not be supported further is poorly understood by both physicians and surrogates . once life supporting care is instituted the patient has options for survival that they did not have before even though they

weight maternal fetal hla matching has been associated with these and other pregnancy obstetric complications maternal fetal hla matching has been observed in another neurodevelopmental disorder and maternal fetal hla matching may occur more frequently in families of individuals with schizophrenia for biological reasons a candidate gene study was conducted to assess maternal fetal genotype incompatibility that is matching at the hla a b and drb1 loci as a risk factor of schizophrenia . if rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility is a risk factor specifically for males one would expect to observe that schizophrenia risk is associated with a birth order effect with male offspring exposed to rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility but not for female offspring . there also is evidence that the clinical effects of rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility may occur earlier in gestation for male fetuses compared to female fetuses . maternal fetal genotype incompatibility can occur when maternal and fetal genotypes differ for example rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility or when they are too similar for example hla b maternal fetal genotype incompatibility . thus one hypothesis is that specific schizophrenia effects of rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility hypoxia hyperbilirubinemia can affect female fetuses but that they are less likely to surpass the threshold of severity compared to male fetuses threshold effect . it is unlikely to be the case that rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility is more likely to occur in pregnancies with male offspring nor is there evidence that its related condition of hemolytic disease of the newborn is more likely to occur in pregnancies with male fetuses compared to female fetuses . however there is evidence that the clinical manifestations of rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility are more severe in pregnancies with male fetuses than with female fetuses . as examples since rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility is genetic in origin one would expect more clustering of schizophrenia in families with rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility than in schizophrenia families without rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility . as examples if the schizophrenia risk effect of rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility is the result of hypoxia then one would expect to observe an interaction between rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility and hypoxia regulated vascular expression genes . the same hypothesis can be tested with hla b maternal fetal genotype incompatibility . the same hypothesis can be tested with hla b maternal fetal genotype incompatibility . the same hypothesis can be tested with hla b maternal fetal genotype

reiterate the pathogenic potential of geotrichum candidum and report its role in causing renal fungal ball . renal colic can be caused by passage of fungal ball that obstruct the collecting system . the saprophytic colonization of a preformed cavity by conglomerate of fungal mycelia without invasion of adjacent tissue is termed as fungal ball or fungal bezoar . genitourinary tract is rarely a site of primary fungal infection with exception of candida species however it may be involved as a result or part of systemic infection . oral infections of geotrichum candidum are clinically similar to candidiasis and commonly associated with diabetes mellitus and hiv infection . diagnosis is established by identification the of fungi in urine and imaging studies using computerized tomography ultra sonography intravenous urography that document obstructive uropathy and soft tissue density with in renal collecting system .", ". . . although predominantly occurring in the granulosa cells of the female ovary gcts are also reported to arise within the male testis as seen in our index case 1 . most patients with gcts are perimenopausal or early postmenopausal with a median age of diagnosis between 5054 years . upto 90 of jgcts are diagnosed in patients under the age of 30 with half of jgct cases seen in less than 10 years of age 22 27 and 10 occurring in infants less than one year . serum mis levels thus correlate well with tumor presence in patients with gcts and elevated levels are considered highly specific for gct in postmenopausal or oophorectomized women . however long term lifelong followup including physical pelvic exam abdominal pelvic ct scan andor tumor markers as available is recommended in all patients with gcts as delayed tumor recurrences beyond 5 years are characteristic of this disease . a common misconception is that the two subclassifications of gcts adult type gct agct and juvenile type gct jgct refer to the age of development . gcts are the most common estrogen producing neoplasms in females and are found to produce estradiol in approximately 4060 of patients . microscopic examination showed the presence of sheets of neoplastic cells interspersed with rupture and acute hemorrhage figure 5a . a simultaneous uterine carcinoma can be found in 510 of patients with gct and are often well differentiated and in an early stage . such symptoms are present in 8090 of patients under the age of 8 with jgct . additionally theca cells interstitial cells and stromal fibroblasts have also been delegated as cells of origin for gct . these tumours arise from granulosa cells that are hormonally active stromal elements in close association with ovarian oocytes which are responsible for the production of estradiol . in early stage patients risk factors for relapse include large tumour size high mitotic index and tumour rupture therefore these features may indicate the need for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy . this hormone is produced exclusively by granulosa cells in postnatal females and both prenatally and postnatally by the sertoli cells in the male testis . the unique presentation of this gct is an acute abdomen due to tumor rupture with hemorrhage . normal granulosa cells are responsible for production not only of estradiol but also peptide hormones including inhibin activin follistatin and antimullerian hormones . serum inhibin levels are currently available for diagnosis and clinical followup of women with granulosa cell tumors of the ovary it can therefore be used to monitor response to therapy or to detect recurrences . the typical clinical scenario of a gct is an older postmenopausal woman with menstrual abnormalities who is found to have a singular pelvic mass that is curable by en bloc resection . estradiol is one of the first hormones to be secreted by gcts and is responsible for clinical manifestations . gct cells usually stain positive for inhibin calretinin cd99 cd56 vimentin estrogen and progesterone receptors . in the indexed case 4 gct was found to coexist with colonic adenocarcinoma as a unique collision tumor which has been discussed previously in detail .  granulosa cell tumours gcts though accounting for approximately 70 of malignant sex cord stromal tumors are rare comprising only 25 of all ovarian neoplasms 13 . locations of gcts included 17 cases in the right ovary 47.2 15 in the left ovary 41.7 and one 2.8 in each of the bowel abdominal wall and omentum . locations of gcts included 17 cases in the right ovary 47.2 15 in the left ovary 41.7 and one 2.8 in each of the bowel abdominal wall and omentum . a ct scan confirmed the presence of a large heterogenous solid cystic pelvic mass figure 4a . of these cases 36 were females and one male index case 4 . of these cases 36 were females and one male index case 4 . after resection gross examination of a jgct is similar to that of an agct . on gross examination necrosis reminiscent of colonic adenocarcinoma admixed with diffuse microfollicular and cords of neoplastic cells were observed figure 4b . tumor rupture is often attributed to hemorrhagic cysts in upto 1015 of the cases 2 27 . this suggests that recurrences in early stage patients may be attributed to preexisting diseased peritoneum during the initial surgery . the preoperative diagnosis of this mass included abscess gastrointestinal stromal tumor and extracolonic mass . immunohistochemical analysis found the neoplastic cells to stain positive for vimentin inhibin figure 5d cd99 and afp . histological features were between those common to adult gct agct and juvenile gct jgct . these patients often have elevated estradiol levels though this is not a requirement for precocious puberty . careful examination of the contralateral ovary and tube intra abdominal organs and peritoneum with sampling of the pelvic and para aortic lymph nodes are recommended . patients with virilising gcts can present with hirsutism clitoromegaly increased abdominal size amenorrhea and deepening of voice . a 3540 cm multilobulated haemorrhagic mass was found in her right ovary and a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy with en bloc mass resection and partial omentectomy were carried out . these lesions are considered a low grade type malignancy with 7090 of neoplasms being diagnosed at stage 1 . within the female population patient s age ranged from 7 days to 85 years with a mean of 52 years median 48 years . within the female population patient s age ranged from 7 days to 85 years with a mean of 52 years median 48 years . juvenile gct jgct is far more common than adult gct agct within the testicle with no preferred laterality within the testis 9 10 . the differential diagnosis of testicular jgct includes yolk sac tumour undifferentiated sex cord stromal tumour gynandroblastoma and gonadoblastoma . ct scan showed a complex mass arising from the anterior bladder wall dome of the bladder figure 3a . deeper sections confirmed the presence of the glandular neoplasm originating from a diverticular outpouching of the overlying colonic mucosa confirming the presence of colonic adenocarcinoma arising in a diverticulum of the large bowel . gct is best considered an unusual indolent neoplasm of low malignant potential with late recurrences that can arise in the ovaries and testicles in both the young and the old . in patients with more advanced disease tah and bso with complete tumour debulking are suggested . depending on 4 variables including age at diagnosis histology therapy and prognosis cells are usually arranged around a central cavity named a call exner body that has a microfollicular growth pattern similar to primordial follicles and contains eosinophilic materials as well as nuclear debris . further a comprehensive fourteen year 19972011 search using the laboratory information system lis identified additional patients with gcts . gcts are unpredictable neoplasms that have the ability to extend locally or spread by lymphatics especially to the para aortic lymph nodes . the mainstay treatment for gct is the same as for epithelial ovarian cancer that is surgical excision 6 20 27 . they have been associated with a variety of genetic abnormalities such as trisomy 1214 monosomy 22 and 90 of adult gct s have a missense somatic c134w mutation in the foxl2 gene . with the clinical suspicion of a urachal carcinoma the patient was taken to the operating room where she underwent a partial cystectomy and anterior abdominal wall mesh reconstruction . only four 10.8 concurrent pathologies included leiomyoma of the uterus 21 benign cysts 14 adenomyosis 7 coexisting ovarian adenocarcinoma 3 and endometrial carcinoma 3 . only four 10.8 concurrent pathologies included leiomyoma of the uterus 21 benign cysts 14 adenomyosis 7 coexisting ovarian adenocarcinoma 3 and endometrial carcinoma 3 . the risk of precocious puberty is especially high in jgct patients under one year of age but gct in this age range is rare . as such seeing past this myth to recognize and identify uncommon realities is necessary for the accurate diagnosis and management of gcts . advanced stage disease is responsive to combination chemotherapy with platinum agents 5 6 . genetically chromosomal abnormalities such as an atypical y chromosome and mosaicism may be present . a 14year 19972011 surgical pathology review yielded 37 cases of gct with an overall prevalence of 0.0041 37902 100 .", "chemotherapy and radiotherapyin addition to what

switch for tinnitus is to be found in these areas that differ between waking and rem state that is the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex frontopolar inferior parietal cerebellar parahippocampal network . it has been argued that the cerebellum is involved in motor sensory and cognitive predictions . of those 76 patients that do recall their dreams 74 97.73 state that they do not perceive tinnitus while dreaming or are not aware of having tinnitus during sleep . in the dream state there is awareness content in consciousness with decreased wakefulness level of consciousness . dreams and wakefulness are both associated with awareness but in one state of awareness there is no tinnitus dreams whereas in the other wakefulness there is tinnitus . it is possible that during the dream state there is an attention shift from the tinnitus to the dream analogous to what is noted in patients who do not perceive their tinnitus when intensely engaged in a task . the reason why patients with tinnitus do not perceive tinnitus in their dream state can be theoretically explained by the bayesian brain model which has been used as an explanation for the development of tinnitus in relation to auditory deafferentation . normally wakefulness and awareness are related one has to be awake that is there has to be a certain level of consciousness to be aware of something that is there is content in consciousness . in view of the pathophysiological analogy between tinnitus and pain it can be hypothesized that tinnitus is absent in the dream state as well . people with tinnitus do not perceive tinnitus in their dreams analogous to what is reported for many phantom limb perceptions 21 25 . other potential explanations for the absence of tinnitus in the dream state have to be considered . there are also parallels between the pathophysiology of tinnitus and pain as well as in the treatment 16 17 . it is therefore possible that auditory predictions are made in the paraflocculus as removing this cerebellar structure can prevent tinnitus from arising and arrest the presence of tinnitus in animals . this means that the discrepancy between top down predictions and the absence of sensory signals received will not be registered and the auditory deafferentation will not be filled in resulting in the absence of tinnitus in the dream state see figures 2a and 2b . however there are also differences between tinnitus and pain . in addition to its evident benefit for tinnitus research it could also provide clues for consciousness research by delineating the core areas involved in the neural correlates of consciousness that is minimal assembly of brain areas required for consciousness per se 38 39 . in conclusion this report demonstrates that tinnitus perception is switched off during dream sleep even though there is awareness like in wakefulness . of the 78 participating patients only 2 2.56 declared that they do not recall their dreams while 76 97.44 do .", "after wide

has been shown to be applicable for i anatomical pathology including intra operative consultation frozen sections surgical pathology second opinions immunostains telecytology e.g. cytopathologists took longer to review a cytology slide using telecytology 94 seconds than they did when examining the same slide with a conventional light microscope 70 seconds robotic real time dynamic telepathology differs from video microscopy because the telepathologist consultant is now actively involved in selecting fields on the glass slide to be viewed . the evolution from static imaging to a wsi scanning system was necessitated due to the lag time required for robotic objective magnification changes and positional adjustments of the slide . today digital pathology has evolved whereby multiplex stained wsi is being used for microscopy and image analytics . robotic telepathology has been extensively used at upmc to remotely interpret intra operative neuropathology consultations frozen sections . however disadvantages of static telepathology relate to the fact that the consulting telepathologist has no remote control of the microscope or imaging device camera their interpretation is limited to only captured field of views the host capturing images needs to have some expertise acquiring images is labor intensive and may cause sampling error if the incorrect images are captured there is frequent lack of clarity with low power magnification images and not all still images are in focus . early and continued adoption of telepathology has provided invaluable experience with digital pathology improved workflow and accumulated resources facilitated funding for equipment it infrastructure and staffing within the transplant pathology division . telepathology is defined as the practice of pathology at a distance transmitting macroscopic andor microscopic images via telecommunication links for 1 remote interpretations telediagnosis second opinions or consultations teleconsultation and educational purposes teleconferencing . finally hybrid technology involving whole slide imaging wsi has emerged that utilizes both dynamic viewing of a digitized scanned slide as well as viewing of selected areas of the saved image at higher magnification . this web based tool was designed to facilitate digital pathology second opinion consults especially for wsi . wsi scanners often have added software available for teleconferencing image management and image analysis . however with the adoption of newer technology trestle scanner replaced the nikon coolscope and increased pathologist experience in 2007 to 2008 comparing 547 conventional frozen sections to 262 by telepathology there was acceptable concordance 78.2 between telepathology and conventional frozen sections . perhaps more importantly this automated system eliminates a person having to email or notify which scan filenames are associated with a case thereby removing the possibility of human error of assigning the wrong slide image to a case digital pathology consultation at upmc has spanned more than a decade . with a robotic telepathology system the operator has remote control of critical motorized microscope functions including glass slide movements in the x and y axes on the motorized microscope stage focus of the glass slide and selection of various microscope objective lenses by a robotic turret . with wsi scanning these magnifications are digitally incorporated into the resultant image as such the time required for biopsy interpretation was greatly reduced . the diagnostic outcome from 2002 to 2006 comparing 1227 conventional frozen sections to 402 performed by telepathology demonstrated that the telepathology deferral rate 19.7 varied and was higher than the deferral rate for conventional frozen section cases 10 . additional disadvantages are the relatively slow scanning of slides approximately 10 min slide the fact that both the host and recipient require integrated software and a required high level of system maintenance for routine optimization cleaning and adjustment . during this time all modes of telepathology have been successfully utilized to exploit our subspecialty expertise and to compete for pathology services . communication was limited to a private network using a thick client server architecture between the host e.g. despite distance however with this client specific model image files are largely outside our control we can not always quickly resolve problems with the client s image server and any network hardware changes on the client s side may cause unexpected instability . expert hematopathologist interpretation is often required for difficult cases e.g. software medmicroscopy and mirax navigator to access scanned images and remotely control robotic microscopes has been made readily available on the internet accessible from any workstation . on site evaluation and ultrastructural pathology as well as ii clinical pathology including telehematology microbiology e.g. medical electronic expert communication system meces with embedded virtual slide technology . newer wsi scanners designed to hold one to four slides are smaller and less expensive . access to the images is direct via secure username password connection to the mdsd system from client pc mac using a java applet for viewing or via affiliated specific workflow applications for the purpose of transplant immunology assessment . however in order to transmit the image over the internet the analog video signal needs to be converted using an ad converter to a digital signal . skype has been shown to be feasible for telepathology in our institutional setting reliance on public servers raises potential security issues which has proven to be a barrier for telepathology . pathology assistant these devices are expensive and because of their point to point network connectivity requirements i.e. while many prior publications regarding telecytology have predominantly utilized static images in practice today most cytology laboratories that use telecytology employ video streaming . the instrument was used to automatically locate and pre classify digital images of white blood cells red blood cells and platelets . high definition digital cameras and teleconferencing software are underway in an attempt to improve our macroscopic teleneuropathology capabilities figure 7 . subsequently during the 12year partnership between upmc and ismett approximately 3000 cases have been reviewed by telepathology . on account of our neuropathology division s unique intra institutional experience they were able to successfully expand their teleconsultation practice across state lines inter institutional with a financially separate medical center in indianapolis indiana . a general portal was developed to be used by all clients and another that required customization for individual clients table 1 . we have provided our pathologists with access to a suite of cloud based applications through a web browser figure 9 . 25 micron forces the human eye to continually focus trying to pull out acute pathology details which leads to fatigue . this will also allow clinicians to view digitized blood smears in real time instead of having to come to the laboratory to physically review the blood smear . teleconsultation in this setting also needs to be performed in a timely manner since rapid and accurate interpretation of allograft biopsies influences outcome after organ transplantation . for remote evaluations of fine needle aspirations cytopathologists demonstrated similar performance using a conventional microscope blue bars and the telecytology system yellow bars for providing tissue adequacy far left bars and the correct diagnosis far right bars . table 2 lists many of the other factors that may need to be considered when practicing telepathology . a trained host e.g. nevertheless occasional difficulties can be experienced when scanning slides e.g. serve database this system allows for automated notification of the upmc assigned pathologist that the case is ready for consult . workflow is handled by managers who triage requests monitor cases and maintain personnel data . licensing issues involved . care taken to avoid folds bubbles etc .", ". these alterations were prevented in tlr4deficient mice

morphological and inflammatory alterations of ewat were prevented in tlr4deficient mice . given the role of tlr4 in adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance and the relationship between adipose tissue inflammation insulin resistance and vascular dysfunction 12 47 the beneficial effect of tlr4 deficiency on arterial remodeling could be explained by the prevention of adipose inflammation and insulin resistance . regarding body weight alterations normoxic and hypoxic tlr4 mice were not different from their respective control animals figure 1b . both parameters were not impaired in tlr4deficient mice suggesting that tlr4 mediated inflammation was involved in this metabolic consequence . the insulin response was not affected in hypoxic tlr4 mice the response curve was almost superposable with those of the normoxic tlr4 animals figures 2c and 2d and not significantly different from the curve of normoxic c57bl6 animals figure 2a . data obtained from animals exposed to ih a validated experimental model of sleep apnea showed that activation of the sympathetic nervous system and systemic inflammation underlie ih induced metabolic and vascular consequences 79 . the direct effect on vasculature could even be predominant as tlr4 deficiency prevented atherosclerosis in ldlr mice with no effect on adipose tissue inflammation and whole body insulin sensitivity . adipose inflammation may have also contributed to lipolysis as we found an increased release of the inflammatory cytokines tnf and il6 from fat pads of hypoxic c57bl6 mice . therefore we assessed whether metabolic and vascular consequences induced by ih involved the proinflammatory tlr4nfb pathway activation . in lean c57bl6 mice we showed that ih induced ewat alterations characterized by fat pad wasting and shrunken adipocytes . regarding the aggravation of atherosclerosis by ih in apoe deficient mice we recently demonstrated that this deleterious effect involved inflammatory alterations of ewat as ewat lipectomy prevented the proatherogenic effect of ih . in the present study we observed increased release of tnf and il6 from ewat and decreased insulin sensitivity in hypoxic c57bl6 mice . here we showed that ewat from hypoxic c57bl6 mice released higher amounts of inflammatory cytokines and that this effect as well as the morphological and inflammatory changes of aorta was

network and induction of cell mediated immunity after initial hr hpv infection table 2 . women with cin i lesions mild dysplasia were excluded since more than fifty percent of our patients with cin i turned out to be hr hpv negative . the significant increase of the four cytokine ratios between cin iii and carcinoma may indicate that the presence of a tumour with an inflammatory reaction and

induced proinflammatory cytokines expression and the expression of anti inflammatory il10 in raw 264.7 and peritoneal macrophages . furthermore il10 sirna significantly reversed the effects of corm2 on tn c and proinflammatory cytokines production whereas tn c sirna significantly decreased proinflammatory gene expression levels without having an effect on co mediated il10 expression . furthermore treatment with co gas significantly increased levels of il10 figure 4c in lps stimulated raw 264.7 macrophages . for 2 h. interestingly corm2 significantly decreased tn c figure 5a tnf and il6 mrna expression figure 5b and protein secretion figure 5c and simultaneously increased il10 expression figure 5d in liver tissue from lps induced endotoxemic mice . also the levels of il10 figure 5e were increased and reversely tn c levels figure 5f were decreased in the serum of mice treated with corm2 . interestingly we found that corm2 significantly increased the level of ho1 expression figure 4o whereas rucl3 did not have any effect on ho1 expression figure 4o and conversely decreased the expression levels of tn c . to confirm the effects of co on tn c meditated inflammation cells were pretreated with or without corm2 or rucl3 negative control for corm2 and then stimulated with or without lps . the inhibition of ho activity using znppix however did not reverse the effects of corm2 on tn c expression figure 4p indicating that corm2 mediated suppression of tn c is independent of ho activity in lps stimulated raw 264.7 macrophages . these observations indicate that the anti inflammatory effects of co are mediated by il10 in lps stimulated macrophages . pretreatment of recombinant il10 with or without lps stimulation showed the same efficiency of corm2 to significantly decrease tn c expression figure 4n . in our study to examine the in vivo effects of co using corm2 on lps induced endotoxemia and tn c mediated inflammatory cytokines expression we pretreated mice with corm2 30 mg kg i.p . interestingly co was found to increase the levels of anti inflammatory il10 while the levels of proinflammatory cytokines were decreased in several in vitro systems 18 29 . therefore in subsequent experiments we measured tn c mrna and protein expression at 8 h. furthermore lps dose dependently increased tn c mrna and protein expression at 8 h figures 1c and 1d . in brain endothelial cells the lps induced activation of inflammatory signals such as nfb p65 cox2 expression and pge2 production was inhibited by corm2 pretreatment . stimulation of macrophages with gram negative bacterial lps can enhance the expression of tn c . in the current study to examine the effects of co we pretreated macrophages and mice with corm2 in an lps stimulated inflammation model . interestingly corm2 significantly decreased lps induced tn c and proinflammatory cytokines production in vitro and in vivo . to further confirm the effects of co on lps induced tn c expression and proinflammatory cytokines mouse peritoneal macrophages were pretreated with corm2 at various concentrations and incubated with lps . higher expression of il10 was found in bmdms from tn c deficient mice while there was lower expression of proinflammatory cytokines indicating an anti inflammatory role of il10 in the tn c mediated inflammatory disease model . similarly pretreatment with co gas significantly decreased lps stimulated tn c and cytokines production in macrophages supporting the direct effects of co on tn c mediated inflammation . the incubation of raw 264.7 cells with tn c sirna significantly suppressed the effects of lps on tn c and proinflammatory cytokines production figures 4f 4g and 4h whereas it had no effect on il10 expression figure 4i suggesting that il10 is regulated independently of tn c and its downstream cytokines . we found that corm2 significantly and dose dependently suppressed the expression of lps stimulated tn c expression figure 2a . after transfection cells were incubated with or without corm2 20 m and then stimulated with or without lps 100 ng ml . in summary we identified that co induced il10 was involved in the inhibition of tlr4 signaling dependent tn c expression and thus inhibited the inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo . in addition rucl3 a negative control for corm2 did not affect lps mediated tn c tnf and il6 expression in macrophages or in septic mice . importantly glucocorticoids can inhibit the expression of tn c in bone marrow stromal cells and fibroblasts . therefore understanding which compounds can inhibit tlr mediated tn c expression and cytokines production may refine strategies to manipulate excessive inflammation . therefore in the current study we examined the effects of co dependent il10 generation on tn c mediated inflammation in macrophages and in the septic mice model . in addition mice and bone marrow derived macrophages bmdms deficient in tn c display lower production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf during lps induced sepsis . in addition mice deficient with tn c displayed lower levels of tnf and downstream cytokine production in lps treated septic mice and bone marrow derived macrophages bmdms . to date there are no reports regarding the effects of co mediated il10 production on the regulation of tn c mediated inflammation . in the present study we found that lps significantly increased tn c and proinflammatory cytokines production in macrophages as well as in a mouse model .", "in this study we found that the patients with t2 dm had increased serum levels of il6 tgf and tnf but decreased percentage of peripheral cd4cd25foxp3treg and serum il10 level . in summary t2 dm patients and the patients with diabetic complication have decreased immunosuppressive cd4cd25foxp3treg cells and increased proinflammatory il10 tgf and tnf. in the present meta analysis of t2 dm patients increased levels of serum il6 tgf and tnf coexisted with decreased levels of il10 and decreased percentage of cd4cd25foxp3treg . many studies have proved the maintenance of immunological self tolerance by cd4cd25treg and cd4cd25foxp3treg . although changes of serum levels of il17 were not significant in this meta analysis of t2 dm patients versus controls il17 may be a clue to the possible involvement of th17 cells in t2 dm pathogenesis . in this meta analysis diabetic complication indeed has an impact on the percentage of peripheral cd4cd25foxp3treg and level of serum il10 . intriguingly t2 dm patients with complication showed lower percentage of peripheral cd4cd25foxp3treg p 0.001 figure 5 whereas patients without complication had decreased levels of serum il10 p 0.033 figure 6 . as shown in figures 28 both t2 dm patients with complication and the patients without complication had significantly increased levels of serum il6 figure 2 tgf figure 3 and tnf figure 4 while not significant changes were found in the percentage of peripheral cd4cd25treg figure 7 and il17 figure 8 . based on the search strategy a total of 5064 articles were collected and 332 were removed after our initial screening . here in this study no significant changes of foxp3treg cells and serum il17 levels were found in t2 dm subjects without complication . enhanced production of il6 and tnf and decreased levels of serum il10 that occurred in t2 dm patients may suppress treg cells and ratios of treg to th17 and th1 cells 132 133 . despite intensive research efforts therefore we performed this meta analysis synthesizing the data from case control studies to evaluate changes of treg il6 il10 il17 tgf and tnf in t2 dm patients . considering the influence of diabetic complications patients were divided into two groups t2 dm with complication and t2 dm without complication for subgroup analysis . t2 dm patients had significantly increased levels of serum il6 smd 1.28 95 ci 0.73 to 1.83 p 0.001 figure 2 tgf smd 2.88 95 ci 2.37 to 3.40 p 0.001 figure 3 and tnf smd 1.56 95 ci 1.10 to 2.02 p 0.001 figure 4 but significantly decreased the percentage of cd4cd25foxp3treg smd 0.47 95 ci 0.72 to 0.23 p 0.001 figure 5 and the level of serum il10 smd 1.37 95 ci 2.32 to 0.42 p 0.005 figure 6 . therefore diabetic complication was a key influencing factor for the high heterogeneity in the meta analysis of tgf but not the others . the finding of decreased percentage of peripheral cd4cd25foxp3treg in t2 dm patients indicates that foxp3 might be a key player for the development and function of treg . t2 dm patients have elevated serum levels of il6 il1 and tgf the cytokines known to induce th17 differentiation . it was found that the ratios of cd4cd25treg th17 cells and cd4cd25treg th1 cells were significantly decreased in t2 dm patients . sensitivity analysis was used to assess the stability of the results by excluding studies with high risk of bias and no significant changes in the results were found . there is an intimate relationship of the differentiation of th17 cells with the relative abundance of peripheral cd4cd25foxp3treg cells and the serum levels of il6 il10 and tgf. furthermore the percentage of peripheral cd4cd25foxp3treg and serum il10 level were influenced by diabetic complication .", "the prevalence of copd according to smoking history and the amount of vitamin c ingested was compared using the chi

waist circumference was measured at the midway between the lower edge of the costal arch and the upper edge of the iliac crest . finally one family member aged 18 years or over was randomly selected from each household using the kish grid method 25 26 . but recent studies using the homa method reported inconsistent effects of smoking in caucasians such as high cell values and ir in normoglycaemic persons lower cell function in men without hypertension and diabetes or no association in men without diabetes . in this population based study we evaluated the associations between chronic smoking and ir and cell function in chinese men without diabetes . however no association was observed between smoking and homa ir in the current study . on the basis of fasting glucose and insulin levels insulin resistance and secretion were evaluated using homa method with the formulas as homa ir fasting insulin mu l fasting glucose mmol l22.5 and cell function homa 20 fasting insulin mu lfasting glucose mmol l 3.5 . no association was observed between former smoking and cell deficiency as well as between smoking status and homa ir . however when the metabolic effects of smoking especially chronic smoking were studied in persons without diabetes the findings were controversial . our results showed that current smoking was associated with decreased cell function in a dose dependent manner and the levels of 2 h glucose were significantly higher in current smokers than in never smokers . our study including 1568 men without diabetes found impaired cell secretion in current smokers which was signified by both low values of homa and fasting insulin . although there were more subjects with hypertension and dyslipidemia in current smokers and more participants who had a higher level of education bmi and waist circumference in former smokers the differences were not statistically significant . the strength of association with cell deficiency was further analyzed after categorizing current smokers according to their pack year of smoking and using never smokers as references . to evaluate the observed association between smoking intensity and cell function in a more dynamic manner we further analyzed the dose dependent effect of smoking intensity as a continuous variable on cell deficiency using fractional polynomial regression model . in addition fasting glucose increased with cumulative intensity of smoking the adjusted means 95 ci were 5.65 5.565.74 5.58 5.445.73 p 0.3857 5.55 5.425.69 p 0.1806 5.72 5.595.86 p 0.3271 and 5.78 5.665.91 p 0.0384 respectively for never smokers and current smokers with the pack year of smoking 10 10 20 and 30 ptrend 0.2177 . a dose dependent effect of smoking intensity was observed to be associated with impaired cell function however not with homa ir . homeostatic model assessment homa using steady state glucose and insulin is a method for assessing ir and cell function and is more appropriate for use in large epidemiological studies . in chinese men without diabetes showed that no statistical difference in homa ir or homa was observed among current former and never smokers . alternately homa a method for assessing ir and cell function from basal glucose and insulin concentration correlates well with estimates using other methods including clamps and is more appropriate for use in large epidemiological studies . in our study increased 2 h plasma glucose during ogtt test indicated probably insulin resistance in current smokers . it is noteworthy that homa ir based on fasting insulin and glucose measurements to determine whole body ir primarily reflects hepatic central insulin sensitivity rather than impaired glucose uptake and consumption in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue peripheral thus limiting its ability to assess ir especially in individuals with igt 4043 . in conclusion our study suggested that chronic smoking impaired insulin secretion and probably brought about insulin resistance in chinese men without diabetes . current smoking was associated with cell deficiency or 1.23 95 ci 1.001.52 compared to never smoking . compared to never smokers current smokers had significantly decreased fasting insulin after adjustment for covariates p 0.0335 . the investigated smoking history included age at smoking initiation years of smoking number of cigarettes smoked per day and smoking cessation . the association was still statistically significant or 1.29 95 ci 1.011.64 after adjustment for age education level drinking status bmi waist circumference level of physical activity hypertension and dyslipidemia . the adjusted means with 95 ci for homa were 54.86 52.1057.78 in current smokers and 58.81 55.5762.24 in never smokers p 0.0257 .", "2 . the type

peeling add uncertainty about whether to use it in all cases . in cases of vmt treatment with ocriplasmin is indicated when traction is 1500 m and in the absence of concurrent macular diseases erm . although anatomic closure in mh surgery is achieved in more than 90 of cases sometimes it does not correlate well with improvement in visual acuity . all cases in which the use of ocriplasmin is considered a first treatment option can be successfully treated by means of vitrectomy . reported bilateral reopening in 38 of cases christmas et al . in the presence of 1500 m traction or erm surgical treatment with vitrectomy 400 m in size with mvt and in the absence of erm enzymatic vitreolysis with ocriplasmin is again the most recommendable option . have analyzed 164 eyes with mh treated by vitrectomy and ilm peeling showing that restoration of the ellipsoid portion of the photoreceptor inner segment is an important prognostic factor for visual rehabilitation after mh surgery . in cases of holes 400 m or in the absence of evident vmt or in the presence of erm vitrectomy is the first option . in another study of 19 patients with symptomatic vma treated with intravitreal ocriplasmin resolution of vma results were significantly affected by lens status with adhesion release in 53 of phakic patients whereas no case of resolution of adhesions was observed in pseudophakic patients . however visual improvement was obtained somewhat earlier in the ilm peeling group and at 3 months improvement was greater if ilm peeling was performed . did not report erm in none of the cases with hole reopening assessed by sd oct . however in a retrospective review of 62 eyes with symptomatic vma treated with ocriplasmin subretinal fluid appeared in 37 of cases with persistence of fluid in 30 of cases after 5 months of follow up . paques et al . paques et al . observed that 73 of cases of hole reopening occurred after a secondary cataract surgery . bhatnagar et al . freund et al . when resolution of the process after one month of the procedure is not achieved vitrectomy with ilm peeling would be the surgical treatment of choice . alteration of the ellipsoid zone on sd oct and a significant decrease in erg amplitudes have been also reported in two patients with release of symptomatic vmt after ocriplasmin injection 45 46 . however kumagai et al . kumagai et al . the incidence of recurrence was 0.39 in eyes with peeling of the ilm increasing to 7.2 with no peeling . yoshida and kishi observed the presence of erm in all cases of reopening of the hole . in a retrospective study 17 patients with symptomatic vmt were treated with a single intravitreal injection of ocriplasmin 0.125 mg . patients with a mh 400 m in diameter were also excluded . pvd is an insidious process that occurs over the course of months or years being asymptomatic in many cases until complete separation of the vitreous from the macula and optic nerve which is the final stage . surgery of idiopathic mh with ilm peeling is a very safe procedure with good anatomic and functional results and scarce postoperative complications . ruiz moreno et al . ruiz moreno et al . reported a 9.5 incidence with a mean follow up of 2 years whereas scott et al . according to these data the authors conclude that ilm peeling offers more favourable cost effectiveness compared with no peeling in mh surgery 81 82 . cataract surgery in the postoperative period of mh surgery has been involved in the reopening of mh . in the study of the moorfields macular hole mmhs group an overall closure rate of 81 at 2 years was achieved in mhs stages 2 3 and 4 as well as an improvement in visual acuity of 636 to 618 which was clearly superior to results obtained in the observation group . besides the ability of indocyanine and infracyanine green to stain the ilm they cause an increase in the biomechanical stiffness of the ilm thereby facilitating its peeling . in another study in which 17 patients were included almost all the patients who responded to the treatment 78 had ellipsoid zone changes on the sd oct figure 3 . in symptomatic patients enzymatic vitreolysis or vitrectomy may be indicated . the availability of oct particularly spectral domain oct sd oct has allowed a more accurate diagnosis and precise assessment of adhesion of the vitreous to the macula differentiating vma from vmt . the favourable results obtained in both clinical trials allowed approval of the use of intravitreal injection of ocriplasmin for the treatment of symptomatic vmt and mh by the food and drug administration fda in the united states in november 2012 and by the european medicines agency ema in may 2013 . even in cases of evolution to a vmt syndrome observation still remains an option given the possibility of spontaneous resolution of vmt . analyzed the results of surgery in a series of 877 cases of mh increasing the reopening percentage to 28.1 with no ilm peeling . by the last follow up spontaneous release of vma occurred in 32 of cases 34 eyes in 30 30 and 57 of grades 1 2 and 3 resp . also in mh stage 2 the efficacy rate was better for ilm peeling than no peeling 91.6 versus 61.3 with an or of 6.19 95 ci 1.6523.20 48 49 83 . this gradually predisposes to pvd defined as separation of the posterior cortex from the ilm of the retina which represents the final step of the normal vitreous aging process 11 12 . in 38 and kumagai et al . with regard to secondary variables day 28 13.4 of patients treated with ocriplasmin showed total pvd as compared to 3.7 of those treated with placebo p 0.001 . the following anatomic criteria should be present at least in one oct image to classify an eye as having vmt a evidence of perifoveal vitreous cortex detachment from the retinal surface b attachment of the vitreous cortex to the macula within a 3 mm radius of the fovea and c association of this attachment with distortion of the foveal surface intraretinal structural changes foveal detachment from the retinal pigment epithelium rpe or a combination of these findings without full thickness interruption of all retinal layers . there were no differences between the groups in terms of severe ocular adverse events including development of mh 5.2 versus 8.6 retinal detachment 0 versus 1.6 and reduced visual acuity 0.6 versus 0.5 . broad ilm peeling to the vascular arcades is recommended so that tangential traction forces on the mh edges are removed facilitating approximation and closure . visual acuity remains stable with a slight tendency towards improvement in the majority of cases . however in the tg mv006 y tg mv007 clinical trials patients with visual acuity equal or lower than 2025 were eligible so that this level of visual impairment can be already considered to be susceptible of treatment . this approach may be also indicated for phakic patients because it does not seem to increase the incidence of cataracts . vma is not accompanied by visual impairment and may be considered a normal finding in the natural course of pvd . those who did not have traction release showed no statistically significant change in vma diameter . in relation to the incidence of reopening with bilateral mh duker et al . vma is characterized by elevation of the cortical vitreous above the retinal surface with the vitreous remaining attached within a 3 mm radius of the fovea as defined arbitrarily . peeling of the ilm during primary mh surgery is one of the factors that has been mostly related to the incidence of reopening varying between 0 and 8 in eyes with ilm peeling 67 9597 and between 2 and 16 in eyes with no peeling 67 9395 97 . studies using sd oct have shown that incomplete vitreous detachment with persistent vitreoretinal adhesions is more frequently observed than by clinical diagnosis . deposition of crystals on the ilm surface helps the achievement of complete removal of the membrane although it is less effective than vital dyes because triamcinolone does not increase the rigidity of ilm . ocriplasmin is a truncated form of human plasmin that induces liquefaction of the vitreous and separation of the vitreous cortex from the retinal surface due to proteolytic activity against main components of the vitreomacular adhesion . recently john et al . in a series of 30 patients reported by dsouza et al . however the use of indocyanine green was associated with potential toxicity in some cases and for this reason trypan blue and brilliant blue are in widespread use in some countries with closure rates of 94 to 100 without apparent severe side effects 7780 . the introduction of optical coherence tomography oct has allowed a more accurate visualization of the macular anatomy and better knowledge of the pathophysiology of the process including measurement and assessment of mh characteristics 57 facilitating treatment decision making . at 6 months there were statistically significant differences in favour of ocriplasmin in the gain of two or more lines 23.7 versus 11.2 p 0.001 or three or more lines 12.3 versus 6.4 p 0.02 . secondary mhs have been reported in cases of blunt ocular trauma lightning strike high myopia 25 31 macular schisis macular telangiectasia type 2 occlusion of the central retinal vein diabetic macular edema uveitis and age related macular degeneration . most adverse events were related to the development of pvd induced by ocriplasmin injection floaters and photopsia . also vma may be subclassified by the size of the adhesion into focal 1500 m or broad 1500 m . indocyanine green and infracyanine green possess a great affinity for the matrix components of the ilm and produce intense staining of the ilm . reported that in the presence of cystic macular edema after secondary cataract surgery there was a sevenfold increase in the risk of reopened holes and garca arum et al and sheidow and gonder reported cystoid edema in combined surgical procedures and that the incidence of hole reopening did not increase in secondary cataracts . for refractory mh to the standard technique or for secondary mh after vitrectomy when peeling of the ilm has been already performed an autologous transplantation of the ilm remnants introduced into the hole with subsequent gas tamponade contributes to the improvement of anatomic and visual outcomes . studies in healthy adults have shown that focal perifoveal pvd occurs in 50 of subjects aged between 30 and 39 whereas complete pvd is found in 50 of subjects aged 70 years or older 13 14 . according to the aperture size mhs are considered small 250 m medium 250 to 400 m and large diameter 400 m . wakabayashi et al . however sano et al .", "1987 . 1987 . 2008 . 2008 . 2008 ishikawa et al . 2008

body weights of 25 kg suggesting the need for higher dosing in small children . in general physiological processes do not scale linearly with body weight consequently children with lower body weights will have higher body weight normalized elimination clearance values . a recent study carried out in cambodia has shown that oral ars at a dose of 6 mg kg day for 7 days resulted in a reduction in neutrophil counts to 1.0 10l and short term neutropenia in 19 of the patients . peripheral blood smears were taken at admission and after 24 h. reduction in parasite load over 24 h survival and severe

continuation of the exercise tasks revealed that the values after each set in the control were higher than those in the experimental group . results obtained during this study revealed that the increase in hr during the exercise was more notable in the control group compared with the experimental group . we concluded that when a partial blood flow restriction was applied during repeated exercise the heart mobilization and recovery features were better reflected in the jt rr ratio than in hr . it was also determined that the application of the partial circulation restriction caused lower jt rr ratio values in the ecg . changes in rr interval or heart rate hr jt interval st segment depression sum of negative values for 12 leads and in ratio of the jt rr intervals were analysed . the results of the research showed that before the exercise the average hr was 69.1 4.0 beats min . the aim of this study was to the effect of a single occlusion training session on the cardiovascular response to bouts of exercise . the data from this study indicate that cardiac muscle strain was slightly lower when the low intensity exercise was carried out with a partial circulatory restriction . in assessment of manifestations of hr fluctuations it was found that the amplitude of hr change in response to exercise repetitions remained the same while the increase in mechanical work duration of the myocardium as indicated by the jt rr ratio was lower which can be interpreted as indicating that the heart could perform its pumping function with more ease . therefore we used a single session of training with an exercise intensity of 40 mvc . the present study found that systolic and diastolic abp were higher throughout the entire study . the results obtained during the study suggest that such kind of occlusion training could be applied for health training and rehabilitation purposes . as shown in other studies low intensity resistance exercise training with occlusion 2050 mvc increases both muscle cross sectional area and strength15 . partial blood flow restriction had an ambiguous effect on blood pressure changes during the exercise . while performing exercise it is important that the body is supplied with oxygen and energy substances . hr showed a significant increase during exercise increasing to 96.3 4.9 beats min in the experimental group and to 94.1 3.8 beats min in the control group . in application of the ecg in sports physiology st segment depression is the key index that refers to the degree of the occurrence of myocardial ischemia . nowadays athletes and coaches are looking for the most efficient training method so as to achieve maximum results and to maintain these results for the longest possible period of time in order to minimize the probability of injury . as a result of these processes st segment depression is visible in ecg records . an example of this is a walking workout using blood flow restriction which has been proven to be a useful method of improving muscle function including muscle hypertrophy strength and endurance . systolic abp values continued to be higher during the exercise while changes in diastolic abp were not registered . when the myocardium is insufficiently supplied with blood there is a lack of oxygen in the myocytes . partial blood flow restriction affects the change in blood pressure during exercise in an ambiguous way . secondly there are authors who claim that training with occlusion does not provided reliable results23 . systolic abp values continue to be higher during the change in blood pressure while diastolic abp changes are not expressed . however some ecg parameters observed in a minority of athletes present diagnostic conundrums . jt rr values registered before exercise during the rest and while at first set of exercises were not significantly different however a tendency for a lower increase in jt rr during the repeated exercise sets performed with partial circulatory restriction was observed fig . during recovery from the first set hr was 84.8 5.4 beats min in the subjects with the circulatory restriction while the value for the other group was 82.0 3.1 beats min . in summary we conclude that applying partial blood flow restriction with occlusion training in the groin area resulted in a lower degree of hr increase in response to repeated exercise compared with training without occlusion . this is of special significance in adolescent or young athletes as it can be used to recognize unphysiological states during workouts .", ". recognition of

even though it is difficult to specify the absolute values of higher levels of peep we think the ardsnet standard peep strategy is the reasonable choice for peep setting because the much higher peep strategy adopted in alveoli trial s higher peep group did not show significant improvement in survival they set peep as high as possible without increasing the maximum inspiratory plateau pressure 28 30 cmh2o by keeping tidal volume of 6 ml kg . using an animal ards model yoshida et al . spontaneous breathing during lung protective mechanical ventilation in patients with ards could induce a large negative deflection in pleural pressure . yoshida et al . yoshida et al . demonstrated in their animal study that spontaneous breathing superimposed on cv could induce lung injury even when plateau pressure was kept below 30 cmh2o . in such cases raising peep might have resulted in overstretch induced lung injury . one study proposed that when optimizing ventilator settings for individual ards patients peep should be adjusted based on esophageal pressure measurements . therefore while raising peep might cause harm in some patients it may benefit others . prophylactic use of lung protective strategies for those patients who are at risk of but have not yet manifested ards might help to avoid its progression . have demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial rct that short term treatment with nmbas 48 hours reduced mortality rates in those patients with early sepsis induced severe ards . recruitment maneuvers should be used in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia prone positioning should be used in sepsis induced ards patients with a pao2fio2 ratio 100 mmhg in facilities that have experience with such practices . as malhorta et al . reported a lower incidence of ards despite an increase in patients severity of illness and comorbidities . however the pleural pressures in the nondependentand dependent lung legions were 7 cmh2o lower and 4 cmh2o higher respectively than the esophageal pressures . another possible explanation could be a decrease of the incidence of ards . this concise review article focuses on the lessons that the surviving sepsis campaign guidelines sscg 2012 report imparts regarding an optimized strategy for mechanically ventilating ards patients . sedative agents and nmba were more frequently used in hfo groups which may have negatively affected patients prognosis . administration of nmbas may be advisable to ease a patient s inspiratory effort in this way thus reducing transpulmonary pressure . chiumello et al elucidated that the specific lung elastance was around 13.5 cmh2o in all the subgroups surgical patients medical patients ali patients and ards patients and was not affected by the peep and tidal volume . fourth high frequency oscillation hfo is now considered as an alternative to conventional ventilation cv . for example among patients with recruitable lung increasing peep may help to avoid the cyclic opening and closing of alveoli without increasing over distention alveolar strain .", "while the medical record documented non compliance the underlying reasons behind non compliance could

the highlights of this study can be the pattern of elderly hnscc patient non compliance revealed that majority of the elderly patients 83 were non compliant to treatment before the initiation of radiation therapy . this was a bit surprising result as elderly patients were expected to be non compliant to treatment during the course of radiation therapy because of development of increased acute radiation morbidity worsening of performance status and poor tolerance.to our knowledge the present study is the first study to report early to mid course non compliance to cancer directed therapy in elderly hnscc patients . other factors which could influence non compliance and were not available include a poor socio economic status b lack of social or family support c distance from the treatment

to study the pattern of non compliance patients were divided into early non compliance patients that were non compliant during the investigation and staging work up period mid course non compliance patients non compliant after complete diagnostic work up and treatment decision but before radiation delivery and late non compliance patients non compliant during radiation delivery . a further analysis on pattern of non compliance revealed that early non compliance to therapy was seen in 5 118 of the patients whereas majority 1418 of elderly patients showed mid course non compliance . the present study evaluated compliance of elderly hnscc to cancer directed therapy . however aging is highly individualized and chronologic age may not reflect the functional reserve and life expectancy

1847 of the patients were not able to complete the stipulated treatment . as per available records the reasons for this early to mid course non compliance finding the probable explanation could be a long median radiation waiting of two months at our cancer center during which some elderly patients may have preferred early cancer directed therapy at some other cancer centers . in the present study elderly hnscc patient compliance in our study is comparable to overall treatment compliance for hnscc patients previously reported from the subcontinent . this aspect of early to mid course non

complicated food matrices without any sample preparation . in this study on the basis of our experience with beer 23 and fruit juice screening 1924 we demonstrate for the first time that nmr is useful for nontargeted screening of baby food formula for health relevant compounds such as melamine and also for labeling controls e.g. from the methods we evaluated the reference lc ms ms procedure was the most sensitive followed by 700 mhz hrmas and then 400 mhz liquid nmr . the spe tubes were conditioned using 15 ml of methanol followed by 15 ml of water . when it became evident that the melamine peak itself could not be measured in water the sample preparation was repeated in 99.8 dmso d6 deutero gmbh while 20 0.4 mg of infant powder was dissolved in 2 ml of dmso d6 . of course the power of nmr resides in the nontargeted approach see below but as we also had previously demonstrated in beer and fruit juice analysis 192324 the same spectra can be used to acquire quantitative data along with the results from multivariate analysis . comparison of melamine contaminated sanlu sample with the reference distribution of a collection of infant formulas measurement in dmso d6 at 400 mhz . other studies have used hrmas nmr to study the structure of a cyanuric acidmelamine system 26 or the formation of melamine condensation products 27 however no h data were presented in either study that could be used as a comparison with our results . upper panel comparison of melamine contaminated sanlu sample with the reference distribution of a collection of infant formulas measurement in water at 400 mhz . such as melamine when we started our study the option for nontargeted screening along with the structural information inside the spectra is certainly the major advantage of nmr over other techniques that have been recently proposed . measuring solution is the final sample extract filled into the nmr tubes or injected into the lc ms ms system . in the first stage for nontargeted analysis 20 0.4 mg of infant powder was weighed and dissolved in 2 ml of waterbuffer solvent 90 distilled water and 10 buffer 1.5 m kh2po4d2o and 0.1 tsp at ph 7.0 to obtain a final concentration of 10 0.2 this solution was shaken for 1 min on a vortex mixer and 3 min in an ultrasonic homogenizer . a 2.5 ml aliquot of the supernatant was placed into a conditioned solid phase extraction spe tube strata x c 200 mg6 ml tubes phenomenex aschaffenburg germany . the 400 mhz procedure showed lower results than either of the other procedures which was judged to be due to an incomplete extraction during sample preparation . after adjustment with acetonitrile to 100 ml an aliquot of the extract was centrifuged and transferred to an spe tube as described above . the successful application of nontargeted screening approaches for food analysis has been previously demonstrated for a number of food matrices 21 . in a comparison of spectroscopic screening techniques much richer information was provided using nmr in comparison to near infrared or fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and selective and sensitive qualitative and quantitative information could be gathered from the spectra 22 . since this procedure yields a robust description a few atypical samples in the reference group the melamine signal of the sanlu infant formula was easily detected manually and in automation since its intensity translates into a z score larger than 56 medianreference z stdreference a z score of about 3 would cover 99 of all samples under normal distribution assumption . the proton hrmas experiments were carried out using a 700 mhz av iii nmr spectrometer bruker biospin rheinstetten germany with a 4 mm hrmas standard bore probe h c p and h lock and gradient . so far only nmr can be seen as a holistic approach for detecting adulteration in infant formula . for example the sanlu sample showed deviations in the range between 3.6 and 4.2 ppm . the limit of detection was 10 ng ml and the limit of quantitation was 30 ng ml . with the intentional adulteration of human foods including baby foods with melamine the economically motivated fraud in the food chain has reached a new dimension for which food control systems were unprepared . then 500 l of acetonitrile water 11 was added and the solution was membrane filtered 0.2 m and used for chromatography injection volume 20 l . because of globalization and the worldwide food trade the melamine contaminated foods were detected in a large number of countries including the united states 14 and the european union 16 . the calibration range was 9 to 900 mg kg and the second curve for the determination of limit of detection was in the range between 0.9 and 9 mg kg . after each elution step the extract was dried at 5060 c using a nitrogen stream . in the same fashion we found that one of the german infant formula samples diverged from all other samples . as we have detailed in consumer safety can not be ensured only by targeted analysis of compounds such as melamine because the adulterators are always one step ahead . these will certainly detect melamine but will miss novel adulterants that might be used in its place in the future . ten milliliters of deionized water a small amount covering the tip of a spatula of ammonium acetate and 0.2 ml of glacial acetic acid were then added to the tube . all spectra

relaxation delay of 4 s and a sweep width of 20 ppm . this approach emphasizes deviating spectral regions and signals which can then be investigated with sophisticated nmr experiments or other conventional analyses . the chemometrical analyses of the spectra were performed using matlab the mathworks version r2008a routines developed in house . twenty two dairy companies were implicated in the melamine fraud with the sanlu company being identified as the one that had most seriously violated the law 13 . the sheath gas was nitrogen at 50 psi and argon was used as the collision gas . in

reflex system . this chinese medical group verified the clinical effectiveness of the nogier approach and assessed the conditions of over 2000 clinical patients recording which ear points corresponded to specific diseases . nogier acknowledged that chinese traditional medicine had been using ear points for acupuncture prior to his discovery but these had been considered empirical points for particular treatments and were not associated with a somatotopic representation of the homunculus in the ear . dr nogier 2 originated the concept of an inverted fetus map on the external ear fig . being able to detect the vas on the radial pulse of the patients left hand enables the practitioner to precisely determine the location of a point whether there is a pathology in the region of the body that relates to specific points and whether certain substances are indicated . then dr nogier noticed that there was a distinct change in the amplitude and dimension of the pulse when certain points on the auricle were stimulated . to experimentally evaluate the claims by french and chinese ear acupuncture that a somatotopic mapping of the body was represented in the external ear 40 patients were examined to determine areas of their body where there was musculoskeletal pain . attending that congress was dr grard bachmann who published nogier s research translated into german in a acupuncture journal in 1957 . thus stimulation of a reflex point in the ear can relieve symptoms of distant pathology with a reliable duration .", "by 1991 business spent 249.4 billion on health care in 1995 including 183.8 billion for employer sponsored health insurance . since 1993 a combination of slower health care cost growth and an upswing in the economy has stabilized or eased the burden that business households and government faced in financing health care . although employees generally incurred both reduced out of pocket costs and expanded services under a managed care plan employers typically paid a smaller portion of the total premium for these plans than for traditional indemnity fee for service plans . in highly competitive markets managed care plans also kept premiums low to increase enrollment and boost market share . this in turn forced traditional indemnity insurance companies competing with managed care plans to develop new low cost products or lose market share . the portion of federal government revenues financing health care costs declined slightly in 1994 and 1995 after several years of significant growth . the majority of spending 182.6 billion was for out of pocket health care expenses not covered by insurance and for copayments and deductibles . the decrease from 24.0 percent in 1993 to 22.8 percent in 1995 was primarily due to an increase in the federal revenues rather than a slowdown in federal health spending . however the employee share of employer sponsored health insurance increased 8.1 percent from 1994more than twice the growth rate of employer contribution to premiums with the result that the share of health plan premium costs paid by employers inched further downward . this coincides with the increased enrollment in managed care plans that have lower deductibles and copayments than traditional fee for service plans . 1996 presents health care expenditure data in an accounting structure that describes the size current growth and historical trends of health care by service matched against the sources that pay the health care bill such as private health insurance phi and government programs like medicaid and medicare . also enrollment in managed care plans grew . the 1993 to 1995 average annual growth of 4.3 percent was the slowest since we began to measure business health spending in 1965 .", "", "the patient presented to the department with dull pain and facial swelling in relation to lower left molar region extending to the angle of mandible . the patient presented to the

0.03 ketorolac 0.4 and 0.5 diclofenac 0.1 nepafenac 0.1 and bromfenac 0.09 reduce postoperative inflammation following cataract surgery.1 similarly prospective randomized studies have demonstrated that diclofenac 0.1 ketorolac 0.4 nepafenac 0.1 and bromfenac 0.09 reduce ocular discomfort after cataract surgery.1 of all the commercially available ophthalmic nsaids ketorolac tromethamine ketorolac possesses the greatest number of studies supporting its efficacy in preventing and treating postoperative inflammation and pain after cataract surgery table 1.521 ketorolac 0.5 acular allergan inc irvine ca is approved by the food and drug administration fda for seasonal allergic conjunctivitis inflammation following cataract surgery and ocular discomfort after refractive surgery.22 to reduce the incidence of burning and stinging a 0.4 concentration of ketorolac acular ls allergan inc was formulated and appears to have a similar therapeutic effect.1823 ketorolac 0.4 is approved by the fda for the reduction of ocular pain and burning following corneal refractive surgery . at the time of writing the pharmacokinetics of acuvail have not been assessed in humans but both acular ls and acuvail formulations were directly compared after a single topical application of 35 l.29 peak concentration in the aqueous humor and iris ciliary body was 389 ng ml and 450 ng g respectively for acuvail and 211 ng ml and 216 ng g respectively for acular ls . more recently a preservative free 0.45 preparation of ketorolac acuvail allergan inc in carboxymethylcellulose was approved by the fda in 2009 for the treatment of pain and inflammation following cataract surgery and is dosed twice daily.24 the specific intent of this review is to assess the available evidence supporting the efficacy of acuvail in the treatment of pain and inflammation after cataract surgery . a pain score of 0 on day 1 was reported in 72 233322 of acuvail patients versus 40 62156 in vehicle patients p 0.001 . older formulations of ketorolac had an incidence of transient burning and stinging on instillation of approximately 2040 for the 0.4 concentration and 40 for the 0.5 concentration.2223 in contrast acuvail was associated with substantially lower rates 1.5 of burning and stinging.21 most importantly a significantly higher percentage of patients randomized to acuvail had a 3line or more improvement in vision from baseline compared with those treated with vehicle.21 at least two previously published studies using ketorolac 0.4 demonstrated a similar beneficial effect upon visual acuity following cataract and vitreoretinal surgery.1737 in patients undergoing routine vitreoretinal surgery patients randomized to ketorolac 0.4 experienced an average 4.3line improvement from baseline compared with a 2.5line improvement with placebo.37 this greater improvement in vision in the ketorolac group was observed despite concomitant corticosteroid use in both groups . although ketorolac is approximately six times more potent as an inhibitor of cox1 than cox2 table 2 it is nevertheless a potent inhibitor of cox2 with an ic50 in the range of 0.090.12 m 33.945.2 ng ml.32 this allows ketorolac to inhibit cox2 in the iris ciliary body after topical application an important fact that can be overlooked if the relative cox1cox2 potencies of ocular nsaids are emphasized . the acuvail group had a significantly higher percentage of patients with a sois score of 0 compared with vehicle at days 7 and 14 . the median time to postoperative ocular pain resolution was one day in patients treated with acuvail and two days in patients treated with vehicle p 0.001 . given the favorable pharmacokinetics better tolerance and reduced dosing requirement of acuvail additional clinical studies comparing acuvail with other nsaids for the treatment of inflammation and pain after cataract surgery are indicated to confirm these promising results . in a study comparing the efficacy of ketorolac 0.5 with prednisolone acetate 1 simone et al observed that prednisolone acetate was more effective at reducing intraocular inflammation by day 7 after cataract surgery than ketorolac although this difference resolved by day 28.10 several studies have demonstrated an additive benefit of a topical nsaid with a corticosteroid and their combined use therefore is common in clinical practice.1 therefore the results of this study can not be directly applied in the setting of concomitant corticosteroid use . in one study after a single topical application of ketorolac 0.4 a peak aqueous concentration of 57.5 ng ml was achieved after 60 minutes.26 another study demonstrated mean aqueous concentration of 1079 ng ml after a total of 12 doses of ketorolac 0.4 administered over 2 days.27 the original ophthalmic formulation of ketorolac is a 0.5 solution marketed as acular . the overall incidence of treatment related adverse events was significantly higher in the vehicle group 14 than in the acuvail group 6.21 the most common adverse events reported were increased intraocular pressure conjunctival hyperemia andor hemorrhage corneal edema ocular pain headache tearing and blurred vision . at day 14 acuvail and vehicle had a sois score of 0 for 53 167318 and 27 41155 of patients respectively p 0.001 . at day 7 acuvail and vehicle had a sois score of 0 for 32 102318 and 17 26155 of patients respectively p 0.001 . waterbury et al directly compared the peak and trough intraocular levels of acuvail bromfenac 0.9 xibrom ista pharmaceuticals inc irvine ca and placebo after three applications 35 l every 20 minutes in an animal model of lipopolysaccharide induced inflammation.30 peak concentrations in the aqueous humor and iris ciliary body were 738 ng ml and 556 ng g respectively for acuvail and 94 ng ml and 46 ng g respectively for bromfenac 0.9 . thus given the favorable pharmacokinetics of acuvail in comparison with these older formulations similar therapeutic benefit may be likely.521 several in vitro studies indicate that ketorolac is the most potent inhibitor of cox1 while both amfenac active component in nevanac alcon laboratories inc fort worth tx and bromfenac have been reported as being the most potent inhibitors of cox2.1263132 bromfenac may be a 318 times more potent inhibitor of cox2 than diclofenac amfenac and ketorolac.2532 another study found that amfenac was a more potent inhibitor of cox2 than bromfenac . moreover cell and flare were combined together in contrast with grading each outcome independently and their summation may have amplified the treatment differences observed between the acuvail and vehicle group . the primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients with a summed ocular inflammation score sois of 0 for anterior chamber cell and flare on day 14 .", "4 . we validated the developed method by using a data set from an independent study that jointly capture transcriptomic

that the effect of chloroquine administration leads to inhibition of dna synthesis . we used gene to reaction mappings available in the metabolic network model to obtain reaction expressions rexp which depend on the expression of a gene or genes catalyzing a particular metabolic reaction . we identified genes that were substantially altered in response to chloroquine treatment and linked to the inhibition of p. falciparum dna replication . we modified our previous approach fang et al . we performed simulations for the mutant parasite in the same way albeit after scaling the model parameters that govern tca cycle enzyme activities by the estimated increase or decrease in reaction fluxes of those enzymes . we identified twelve distinct genes that were substantially affected in pf3d7 and pfdd2 after chloroquine treatment importantly preventing their down regulation in response to chloroquine treatment was sufficient for restoring the p. falciparum dna synthesis inhibited by chloroquine treatment see table 1 . 2010 rahman et al . 2014 that integrates hourly gene expression data with a whole genome metabolic network model to estimate the hourly metabolic flux profiles of p. falciparum during the 48h long idc period . 2014 to simulate time dependent dna synthesis during the idc . these genes were not mentioned in the original transcriptome analysis of hu and colleagues who used a fundamentally different approach to interpret their transcriptome data hu et al . this is mainly because such an approach requires gene expression data throughout the idc to predict the corresponding metabolic flux profiles . the model was identical to a previously published model fang et al . 2b shows the predicted alterations in tca cycle metabolites in response to genetic perturbations of tca cycle enzymes fig . 2013 lehane et al . we found that 81 metabolic reactions in our network model are critical for p. falciparum dna synthesis . for example our model analyses suggest that administration of h2o2 would potentiate parasite killing by chloroquine consistent with in vitro experiments malhotra et al . 2013 loria et al . 2010 obtained p. falciparum transcriptome data at only 8 selected time points during the idc . 2015 adequately represent the reaction fluxes in vitro then the predicted changes in reaction fluxes should be sufficient to predict the changes observed in the corresponding metabolomic data . 3 indicate that chloroquine treatment inhibits replication of p. falciparum dna which in turn suggests that pathways essential for dna synthesis are inhibited . therefore we aimed to develop a method that could utilize a reduced transcriptomic data set to predict alterations in metabolic flux profiles during the idc . 2010 administered chloroquine 18 h after erythrocyte invasion at concentrations of 41 72 and 144 nm for pf3d7 and at 43 nm for pfdd2 and obtained gene expression profiles every hour for 8 h during the idc following the chloroquine treatment . 2010 with a whole genome network to predict metabolic flux profiles during the idc . currently there is no approach to integrate limited data such as those reported previously hu et al . 2009 song et al . however such data are often collected at a limited number of time points for instance hu and colleagues hu et al . although chloroquine could specifically intercalate with the identified core gene set in accord with the dna intercalation theory of chloroquine meshnick 1990 obrien et al . 1nj1tnrij obtained by summing the values across all time points in the idc tracks with

in the laparotomy group were later scheduled for adjuvant radiation therapy . indeed evidence from laboratory studies has shown that many lymphatic and lymphatico venous shunts that bypass regional lymph nodes exist and allow an early stage lymphatic and hematogenous dissemination of malignant cells . in our study group almost 90 of the patients in the laparoscopy group had stage i or ii disease following surgical staging whereas only 70 of the patients in the laparotomy group had early stage disease . a laparoscope with 5to 7fold magnification could sometimes be superior in identifying such deep bleeding locations however difficulty in suturing or unavailability of vascular clamps may prevent the appropriate approach . two 7.7 patients in the laparoscopy group and 4 15.4 in the laparotomy group had pelvic lymph node metastasis . it might not be easy sometimes to overcome such bleeding even during laparotomy because of the depth of the location of bleeding preventing easy access to the area . however experience is of the utmost importance and there is no way to start scoping without proper training . duration of laparoscopic surgery does not seem to be different from that of laparotomy . lymph node dissection was performed in 25 patients by laparoscopy and in 24 patients by laparotomy . blood loss and yield of pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes duration of surgery

surgery . laparoscopy has a similar success rate when compared with laparotomic staging and it can be accepted as less invasive . shorter hospital stay and less postoperative morbidity are advantages of laparoscopic surgery . scribner et al compared laparoscopy and laparotomy in a similar number of patients as in our study . thirty seven patients were treated in the laparoscopic group versus 33 patients in the laparotomy group . feasibility of laparoscopic staging in incompletely staged endometrial cancer patients is another subject of interest . while comparing laparotomy and laparoscopy the number of residual nodes following lymphadenectomy has also been studied because lymph nodes left in situ might have had microscopic metastases . port site metastases are one of the most often addressed issues in patients undergoing a laparoscopic procedure for any kind of gynecologic cancer . in contrast to scribner s study gemignani et al found the overall charges in the laparoscopy group significantly lower than that of laparotomy group considering fewer postoperative complications seen with the laparoscopic approach a factor that lowers overall hospital charges . the patients were randomly assigned to the surgical approach and informed before surgery about the type of surgery they were to undergo . another randomized study comparing the laparoscopicvaginal approach with the conventional abdominal approach for treatment of patients with endometrial cancer was performed including 70 patients with endometrial cancer figo stage i iii . the laparotomy group had an average age

the acyl coa thioesterase family members can be divided into two distinct groups type i and type ii . type ii acots make up the second group these enzymes are members of the hot dog fold enzyme superfamily which includes a wide variety of functionally diverse proteins . acot13 previously called thioesterase superfamily member 2 them2 differs from the other type ii acots in that it contains a single hot dog domain . amino acid sequence identity between type i and type ii human acyl coa thioesterases acots . another protein thioesterase superfamily member 5 them5 shares more than 37 per cent identity with them4 but lacks significant sequence homology with acot13 . furthermore type ii proteins them4 and them5 do not share sequence homology with other hot dog domain superfamily members . bile acid acetyl co a amino acid n acyltransferase baat thioesterase superfamily members 4 and 5 them4 and them5 are the closest related homologues to type i baat and type ii sequences them4 and them5 . to date four type i and six type ii genes have been identified within the human genome . acot1 acot2 and acot4 contain an n terminal acyl coa thioester hydrolase domain pfam 04775 . acot11 and acot12 share 51 per cent sequence identity and both enzymes contain a c terminal steroidogenic acute regulatory protein starrelated lipid transfer start domain which seems to be specific to mammalian evolution . acot1 and acot2 are the most closely related having 98 per cent amino acid sequence identity . proteins that share this common structural element make up the functionally diverse hydrolase fold superfamily of enzymes . the superfamily has diverged greatly and many members share very little sequence homology but are considered evolutionarily linked based on structural homology . there are two additional genes them4 and them5 which gene products share both structural and sequence homology with other type ii proteins . there is no sequence homology between the two groups and the translated proteins have very different domain architecture indicating two distinct evolutionarily unrelated origins figure 1 and most likely an example of convergent evolution . them4 was identified as having acyl coa thioesterase activity and should be considered as a new family member . this finding suggests that acot4 was an ancestral gene encoding an acot4 enzyme with broad substrate recognition and that gene duplication events led to acot1 or 2 and that further duplication events led to the mouse acot3 and acot5 genes encoding the acot3 and acot5 enzymes which have similar substrate specificity to that of mouse acot4 and human acot4 . with the exception of acot13 all type ii proteins contain double hot dog domains which may have evolved as a gene duplication event that allowed for the accommodation of bulky substrates . type i acot branches are highlighted in blue whereas type ii are in red . this small degree of homology suggests that the two proteins may share common evolutionary ties . this cladogram clearly shows that prior to the mammalian radiation approximately 75 million years ago mya there was a single ancestral acot1 or 2 gene after the mammalian radiation but before the mouse rat split at approximately 15 mya this single ancestor divided twice to become four rodent acot functional genes now named acot1 acot3 acot4 and acot5 . type i proteins belong to the hydrolase fold superfamily whereas type ii proteins fall into the hot dog fold superfamily . a cladogram depicting the evolutionary relationships observed between human mouse and rat

transmissible human adapted phenotype was sobering . we found that this work had great potential for harm or misuse and recommended that the general conclusions highlighting the novel outcome be published but that the manuscripts not include the methodological and other details that could enable replication of the experiments by those who would seek to do harm the recommendation not to publish scientific results was highly unusual and the first such recommendation by the nsabb membership . the details of the research on the other hand would add little to this short term effort and could enable someone to replicate the work in a short period of time . the short term negative consequences of restricting experimental details seemed small in contrast to the large consequences of facilitating the replication of these experiments by someone with nefarious intent . we are all aware of the rapid global spread of human adapted influenza both on a yearly basis and during less common pandemics . research and public policy will be developed from this global engagement process a process that should increase the public s confidence in the scientific endeavor in scientists ethical behavior and in the transparency that a free research environment embraces . i carefully considered how restricting the information would compromise scientific research progress and even how it would hinder public health efforts to prevent such a horrific pandemic . these papers contained results on the adaptation of the highly pathogenic avian influenza a h5n1 virus to mammalian hosts

prevent a barrier to the disclosure of personal health information among healthcare providers hics are permitted to disclose phi for the purposes of providing or assisting in providing care on the basis of implied or assumed implied consent canadian hiv aids legal network 2014 cavoukian and rossos 2009 . patients are encouraged to stand up for and assert their rights to privacy canadian hiv aids legal network 2014 fletcher 2014 but is this a realistic expectation and outcome although disclosure of phi often occurs by well intentioned healthcare providers wlwh believe there will be serious repercussions if they call on healthcare providers who have disclosed their hiv status to account for their inappropriate behaviour ion et al . it must also be recognized that not only do plwh have a right to privacy regarding their phi hics owe a duty to plwh to keep their phi confidential canadian hiv aids legal network 2004 . moreover healthcare providers and trainees may not truly understand their accountability and duty of confidentiality requirements canadian hiv aids legal network 2004 . for example just because discretionary disclosure clauses permit disclosure of phi under privacy legislation does not mean that the disclosure is necessary and valuable for the provision of care canadian hiv aids legal network 2004 . furthermore when phi is disclosed to a non hic outside of the circle of care or for purposes other than delivery of healthcare express consent is required beardwood and kerr 2004 cavoukian 2008 . at the same time phipa permits disclosure of phi without implied consent in a number of vague and unspecified circumstances including providing healthcare as an individual healthcare provider or as a facility managing risks and error beardwood and kerr 2004 planning and management of the health system and analysis of the health system etc . most privacy breaches are avoidable even if conducted by well intentioned healthcare providers regardless of the intention behind the behaviour the effect and consequences are the same fletcher 2014 and hics who willfully collect use or disclose phi in contravention of phipa can be found liable beardwood and kerr 2005 . what followed was legislation that extended the protection of personal information in the private sector in canada and in 2001 the personal information protection and electronic documents act pipeda came into effect canadian hiv aids legal network 2004 peekhaus 2008 . at the meso level of systems buffet and kosa 2006 have investigated how hics ensure that patient preferences regarding disclosure of phi are acted upon . whether individuals are hics or agents of a hic their obligation to abide by phipa and ensure the security confidentiality accuracy and integrity of phi in their custody is the same fletcher 2014 peekhaus 2008 . the choice of wlwh not to respond to or hold healthcare providers accountable for disclosing their hiv status sheds some light on how power dynamics may flourish within healthcare systems and may not always position the patient at the centre of care . furthermore expecting patients to express their privacy complaints to individual healthcare providers then channel these complaints to the upper echelons of a healthcare corporation as well as a provincial body like the office of the information and privacy commissioner is a tall order . employing hiv in this way may help those providing care to ensure appropriate checks and balances within a woman s care plan gagnon 2014 2015 . enhancing education training and resources for

increased apoptosis and inflammation as well as age associated gender differences in nfb signaling . in light of the fact that within human females natural menopause and ovariectomy results altered hormonal profiles and cardiovascular risk the data suggest that age associated cardiovascular disease in human females may be associated with both time dependent hormone deprivation and age associated changes in structure function and protein signaling . studies investigating the details of cardiac signaling with gender and aging are likely to lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for cardiovascular diseases in both male and females . comparisons between aging research in female rats models and humans can be complicated due to the differences in the mechanisms of ovarian hormone aging in human females and its potential impact on cardiovascular disease . to our knowledge only a few studies have investigated the changes in nfb expression and activity in the aging female rat heart . like humans rats also appear to exhibit several age associated changes in vascular structure and function including changes in intimal thickening elevations in inflammation associated molecule expression and increased evidence of oxidative stress 4 140 . similar to that observed for the heart age associated changes in the expression activity of nfb were found in the vascular smooth muscle cells of the aorta . aging associated increases in oxidative stress can lead to alterations in the cardiac cell signaling which may lead to deleterious changes in the heart . another research has shown that vscm proliferation and nfb activation stimulated by interleukin1 were increased more in aged female rats than young female rats . the increased risk of cvd in human females may be due to differences in the type or magnitude of age associated alterations in cardiac structure and function . however additional research examining how aging may affect cardiac structure and function in rats is needed to determine whether the alterations seen in rats mimic the changes seen in humans . works investigating mapk signaling in aging human hearts have demonstrated reduced p38 mapk activity signaling in heart failure and impaired activation of mapk target genes following increase in oxidative stress 9698 . in humans a higher number of tunel positive myocytes are seen in young males compared to females aging appears to increase cardiac apoptosis in male but not female however there was no gender difference in apoptosis in male and female f344 rat 92 135 . functional changes with age in the vasculature consist of impaired distensibility increased stiffness increased endothelial permeability attenuation of 2adrenoceptor vasodilator response to agonists and diminished response to adrenergic receptor stimulation 4 139 . in male rats age associated increases in cardiac fibrosis as well as the changes in gap junction morphology have been hypothesized to cause changes in cardiac conduction in addition to the incidence of arrhythmias and death 68 70 . although estrogen 17 estradiol has been shown to activate enos estrogen studies in rats have shown no effect or increased enos expression following estrogen treatment . the increase of apoptosis in the aging male f344xbn was highly correlated to age associated increases in oxidative nitrosative stress . the mechanisms responsible for age associated alterations in no synthesis are not fully known but may include changes in activity or expression of enos increased breakdown of no due to oxidative stress oxidative injury changes in antioxidant defense systems and decreased availability of enos substrate l arginine although the activity of enos is generally thought to be diminished with aging in the aorta . mapk signaling is involved in many of the age associated physiological changes hypertrophy oxidative stress and apoptosis as well as other cardiac pathologies . in rats ovariectomy causes alterations to heart structure and function which include increases in cardiac interstitial space cardiac fibrosis heart weight and left ventricular weight . research in other rats namely aging female dahl salt sensitive rats has shown that female rats are more likely to develop hypertension after ovariectomy . although a limited number of studies have looked at how cardiac structure and function change with age in female rats very few have directly investigated how sex may affect cardiac structure and function . why cvd risk may differ between men and women is not well understood but may be related to differences in age associated cardiovascular function . although aging is associated with increases in oxidative stress in both male and female rat hearts female rat hearts exhibited lower mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production oxidative damage and a greater mitochondria differentiation compared to that seen in male animals . additionally no significant change was noted with myocardium left ventricular or right ventricular free wall weight in the aging human female heart with no underlying cardiovascular pathology nor were age associated changes detected in proportion shapes size or number of mononucleated and binucleated cardiac myocytes . fannin and colleagues found that increased age in the female f344xbn was associated with increases in oxidative stress and damage . because cardiac structure function signaling and hormonal response appear to differ between male and female rats and humans with aging care must be taken in evaluating current literature with regard to specific finding and gender . similar to that seen in other parts of the cardiovascular system differences in aortic structure and function between genders have also been observed in the aging human and animals . whether aging in animal models mimics many of the cardiovascular changes seen in humans is not well understood . ovariectomized rats appear to exhibit increased evidence of oxidative stress and cardiac apoptosis 4751 . studies have found that the majority of human females who undergo natural menopause exhibit different age associated cardiovascular alterations than those who underwent ovariectomy induced menopause . aging female rat cardiac structural changes included a dilatation of the left ventricle between 13 and 22 months of age . as humans age there is an increase in the ekg abnormalities which are associated with increased mortality . rats are widely used in aging research as they exhibit a relatively short lifespan and are genetically quite homogenous . the incidence of cells undergoing apoptosis in the heart has been shown to differ with sex in humans and rats . aging has also been shown to increase the activation phosphorylation of p4442 and jnk mapks in the aorta while another work has shown that aging affects the ability of the aged aorta to activate p38 and jnk mapk signaling following mechanical loading . although the human aging aorta did not show increases in aortic stiffness it has been documented that the increased vascular stiffness with aging is more prominent in male than female animal models 143 144 . in order to overcome the difficulties found in aging human research ethics cost and long lifespan rat models have been used to provide great insight in investigating age related changes in cardiovascular structure and function . go demonstrated that cardiovascular aging in male and female rats demonstrated significant gender differences in lv size and function . aging in the male rat heart is associated with the accumulation of oxidative damage to lipids and proteins as well as decline in mitochondrial enzymes . though not demonstrating cause and effect these results suggest that increased cellular ros and cardiomyocyte apoptosis may play a role in age related cardiac remodeling . boluyt and colleagues investigated how aging may affect cardiac structure and function in female f344 rats using echocardiography . the reasons for this increase in cvd risk following menopause is currently unclear however it is well known that early menopause is associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease death 1921 . similar to the mapk proteins the nuclear factorb nfb pathway is thought to play a role in cardiac remodeling apoptosis acute ischemia and reperfusion and unstable angina as well as heart failure in both humans and rodents 109112 . although multiple studies have investigated ekg changes in aging rats these parameters have not been determined in the nia approved aging f344xbn rat model . the pharmacological acceleration of ovarian aging using 4vinylcyclohexene diepoxide vcd accelerated ovarian failure aof model or ovariectomy ovx procedures are often performed due to the lack of natural menopause in rat research models because they are believed to better mimic the hormone milieu seen in aging human females . further increased age was also associated with diastolic dysfunction alterations in heart rhythm intervals and alternations in connexin 43 expression . in male wistar rats the pr and corrected qt intervals alterations in aging electrocardiogram parameters have been shown to be rat strain dependent and could only be detected subsequently to heart failure as in male shhf mcc cp rat strain at 19 months of age . given this information it appears that natural aging in human females is not associated with cardiac remodeling during or after menopause in the absence of preexisting pathologies or loading abnormalities . though not fully understood it is thought that the loss of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in aging human females is due to the decrease in the ovarian follicular reserve . olivetti and colleagues have demonstrated a small decrease in human heart weight with aging in males but not females . to our knowledge no studies have looked at hsp27 hsp70 and hsp90 in the aging female heart . the exact role that increased levels of oxidative stress may play in the development and progression of age associated cardiovascular disease remains to be determined . vcd in juvenile 1 month and adult 3 months sprague dawley rats depleted follicles but had no effect on the duration or onset of persistent estrus . in addition to changes in enos activity decreased no availability during aging can also be caused by oxidative stress and alterations in enos structure 155 156 . conversely aging female rats experience a persistent estrous cycle due to chronic anovulation which consist of pseudopregnant disestrus estrogen levels as well as high progesterone levels from increased ovulation and the corpora lutea . similar alterations in electrocardiogram parameters have also been found in aging rats . the presence of age associated cardiac structural changes in the f344 and f344xbn animal models calls into question the use of these strains for translational data in light of the absence of age associated change in human females reported by olivetti et al . in aged animals the activation of p4442 mapk in vascular smooth muscle was increased compared to young animals 145 171 . as expected bilateral oophorectomy is associated with different hormonal alterations including changes in estrogen production and reduced levels of progesterone and testosterone as well as increases in gonadotropins lh and follicle stimulating hormone fsh compared to those that occur in human females who experience natural menopause 45 46 . it is thought that differences in mapk activation between male and females may be regulated at least in part by the influence of estrogen 66 115 116 . structural changes found in the aging vasculature include an enlarged lumen media intimal thickening irregularly shaped endothelial cells migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells increased deposition of extracellular matrix increased expression of adhesion molecules and alterations in the expression of metalloproteinases as well as cytokines 4 136138 . although cardiovascular risk increases with age in both sexes the increase in age associated risk appears to be sharper in women . however the fact that human females do not display cardiac hypertrophy or myocyte loss in the absence of loading abnormalities with aging may suggest the presence of estrogen prior to menopause acts to attenuate the cardiac response to preexisting underlying pathologies . aging is believed by some to be a progressive disorder that decreases an organism s ability to maintain reproductive capacity and normostasis . in vascular smooth muscle cells from young female wistar kyoto rats estrogen inhibited vsmc proliferation following stimulation with fetal calf serum similar decreases in vsmc proliferation with estrogen treatment following cell stimulation by growth factors or mechanical stress have also been noted 161 163 .", "only . . . unfortunately characteristic for mpn macroscopic changes in kidneys can not be found after a shorter period of ota exposure via the feeds even with such high levels as 1000 ppb ota and animal products containing dangerous ota contamination levels could easily pass meat inspection at slaughterhouses . moreover it appeared that all of the mentioned above antidotes used as supplements to the feeds especially sesame seed and artichoke extract had a potent protective effect against ota induced toxicity and could be used as a practical approach for safely utilizing of ota contaminated feed . the same include the use of management practices to prevent the production of ota by the storage fungi the feeding of contaminated grain to animal species that are less susceptible to the toxic effects of ota such as ruminants modification of the diet to promote enhanced hydrolysis of ota in the gastrointestinal tract or reduced absorption the use of a feeding regimen that can counteract the metabolic effects of ota the use of various procedures that can destroy ota such as physical and chemical methods for decontamination of commodities as well as the use of various feed additives which can protect against the toxic effects of ota etc . moreover degenerative and weight changes in kidneys liver and lymphoid organs as well as immunosuppression were seen recently in chickens at only 0.2 or 0.3 ppm ota in combination with pa 26 27 29 30 47 whereas such changes had been seen in chickens exposed to significantly higher levels of pure ota about 4 ppm in feed 4851 . in addition to the contraction of kidneys in later stages of bulgarian mpn and ben there are various other similarities between ben in humans and bulgarian mpn as the low contamination levels of ota in feeds or foods and serum neoplastic changes in kidneys pigs figure 2 or urinary tract humans retention cyst formation in proximal tubules of kidneys vascular lesions in kidneys electron dense formations and myelin like figures in mitochondria of epithelial cells figure 3 . the same mycotoxins were recently found in high contamination levels especially fb1 and pa in most of the feeds originated from farms with mycotoxic porcine or avian nephropathy in bulgaria unpublished personal data . it is known that ota induces an increase of the weight of the organs taking part in its detoxification or elimination kidneys and liver as well as a decrease of the lymphoid organs weight and body weight whereas some of the studied feed additives 5 artichoke extract 0.02 roxazyme g 8 sesame seed 0.0025 phenylalanine significantly protects against these weight changes as the protective effect of sesame seed and roxazyme g against these weight changes was stronger than the protective effect of artichoke extract and phenylalanine . moreover the cynarine content in such extract stimulates metabolism of cholesterol decreases serum urea and lipids improves diuresis and increases biliary secretion which probably augment the hepatobiliary route of excretion of ota ota is mainly eliminated via bile and urine and thereby has been found to protect against ota nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity 26 27 29 30 94 as well as against the immunosuppressive effect of ota 27 94 104 or against ota induced anaemia . therefore the regulations in denmark according to which all enlarged and mottled kidneys are investigated for residues of ota at slaughter time and all carcasses whose kidneys contained ota levels above 10 g kg are condemned are not very safe and clever because macrscopic changes in kidneys can be found only after 13 months ota exposure via the feeds 22 118 . however the analysis for ota of various feed samples from farms with high frequency of spontaneous mycotoxic porcine nephropathy mpn revealed that the values were substantially low and ranged from 38 to 552 mean 207.1 65.14 ng g for 1993 and from 42 to 427 mean 114.06 35.79 ng g for 1994 respectively . the addition of phenylalanine to cell cultures containing ota in vitro or coadministration of phenylalanine with ota 88 89 reduced ota induced inhibition of protein synthesis . it might also avoid the increase of ota absorption from the stomach and intestine provoked by the pure phenylalanine in feeds . several years ago it has been found that the toxicity of various strains of the same aspergillus ochraceus group is very different independently of the capacity of ota production 22 26 27 . the multimycotoxin etiology of mpn man in bulgaria is recently confirmed as high contamination levels of pa 8386 2239 g kg 88 positives and fb1 55641 584 g kg 96 positives in bulgarian feed samples from farms with mycotoxic porcine nephropathy were found whereas the levels of ota 1888 273 g kg 100 positives in the same feeds were consecutively lower unpublished personal data . the main reason for that could be the circumstance that phenylalanine was found to increase the absorption of ota from the stomach and intestine as well as the gastrointestinal transit of ota . the daily intake of humans calculated on the basis of the average plasma levels of ota in endemic area in bulgaria was found to be between 26.8 and 36.4 ng kg b. w. as can be seen from table 5 1 124 . a protective effect against ota induced decrease of total serum protein was found in chicks of all antidote treated groups mentioned above but a protection against the increase of serum glucose was only seen in groups treated with roxazyme g and artichoke extract . it is important to mention that kidney damages in spontaneous mpn in bulgaria figure 1 are more similar to those in balkan endemic nephropathy ben in humans than in danish mpn . therefore phenylalanine has to be given after changing the feed source and stopping ota exposure of animals . recently however more and more evidences appeared that exposure to more than one mycotoxin may be an important factor in etiology of ben and mpn . in addition the protective effect against the increase of serum values of uric acid and creatinine was strongest in the group treated with sesame seed table 3 . parker and colleagues showed that pa inhibits carboxypeptidase activity in vitro and in vivo and such inhibition may significantly impair the primary detoxification of ota in the intestinal tract and so be partly responsible for the enhanced toxicity of ota observed in combination with pa 22 2630 . the higher toxicity of ota in all above mentioned studies might be due to synergistic toxic effects between ota and pa as has been reported in mice 41 42 and in poultry . leitao and collaborators demonstrated that phosphine ph3 was effective at inhibiting both fungal growth and sterigmatocystin production by a. versicolor and this could be considered as another specific way to control the growth of ota producing fungi . moreover the sesame seed 8 to the feed increases the energy metabolism in animals which usually is disturbed by ota . also the same changes apoptosis and karyomegaly in tubular epithelium provoked by p. polonicum extract could be induced by another unknown mycotoxin this would be of interest because the same mycotoxin could be partly responsible for the nephrotoxic damages described in bulgarian nephropathy . in such a way the extent to which ota may interact with other components of commercial chicken pig rations or human food compounded from agricultural produce may also influence the significance of the relatively lower doses of ota that commercial chickens 23 27 pigs 18 21 or humans may encounter in some feed food . the use of various procedures that can destroy ota such as physical and chemical methods for decontamination of commodities can be considered as another important way for safely utilizing of feedstuffs . recently it was found that pathomorphological changes including electron dense formation and myelin like figures induced in pig s kidneys by combined exposure to such low contamination levels of ota together with pa are more similar to those in spontaneous mpn in bulgaria than to classical danish mpn . small concentrations of these compounds are able completely to inhibite the growth by both genera of fungi and their ota production . moreover 11 of 31 patients with urinary tract tumors in france exhibited a ota specific dna adduct pattern similar to those found in bulgarians suffering from ben ota treated rodent and bulgarian pig suffering from nephropathy . some mycological investigations of ota contaminated feeds in bulgaria revealed the common presence of p. aurantiogriseum complex which is a potent producer of pa . these high concentrations suggest for a possible role of ota in a disease causation of ben . having in mind the strong carcinogenic effect of ota its ptwi was later decreased to 100 ng kg b.w . in countries with wide spreading of mpn and man residues of ota were often found in animal tissues samples during the meat inspection 18 23 114 115 116 . for foods with ph values from 5 to 6 such as the cereals or sorghum the antimicrobial agent food additive that is able to prevent the growth and ota production by aspergillus and penicillium species is methyl paraben or potassium sorbate . this could explain why the low levels of ota in bulgarian feeds for pigs 18 21 chickens or humans have such high toxic effect on kidneys when ingested with spontaneous contaminated feeds . the production of pa decreased sharply at low oxygen concentrations while fungal growth was not noticeably influenced . the rosallsat is found to inhibit lipid peroxidation unpublished personal data and in such a way prevents one of the mechanism of ota toxicity . it has been recommended as a diuretic agent in cardiac and renal insufficiency and might accelerate the urinary route of excretion of ota 26 27 30 . as a whole the frequency and duration of the observed nephropathy in different batches of slaughtered pigs varied significantly from 12 up to 8090 frequency and have depended on the duration of feeding of various suspected feeds stored for a long time in poor conditions and at high humidity 1821 . such synergism between ota and pa or other mycotoxins under field conditions may be responsible for the spontaneous mycotoxic nephropathy in bulgaria which can be caused by relatively low contamination levels of ota in feed 18 21 23 . the mean concentration of ota in human blood in bulgarian endemic areas ranges respectively from 20 g l for 1986 to 27.2 g l for 1989 130 132 . these studies suggest that little or no benefit is obtained by supplementing ota contaminated diets with phenylalanine . this circumstance in addition to low feed food levels of ota in bulgarian mpn and ben suggest a possible interaction between ota and other mycotoxins which needs to be proved figure 3 . according to laciakova and collaborators formic acid of 0.25 concentration degraded ota after 3 h exposure propionic and sorbic acids in 1 concentration after 24 h exposure and benzoic acid in 0.5 concentration after 24 h exposure . however these pathological changes have not been observed in classical mpn as described in denmark or elsewhere . several different approaches have been used to reduce ota absorption including the use of hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate hscas bentonite charcoal and cholestyramine . which corresponds to about 14 ng kg body weight per day . the pa induced hepatobiliary excretory dysfunction may also result in decreasing of hepatobiliary excretion of ota . via the feed or water usually contains various biologically active compounds cynarine flavonoids cynaropicrin dehydrocynaropicrin grosheimin as well as a high content of calcium and ascorbic acid . however the growth of a. ochraceus on natural substrates has not been associated with a natural occurrence of ota . in such a way the exposure of humans to this very hazardous and relatively heat stable toxin from chicken pigs meat can be prevented . a method is also presented for calculating the daily consumption of ota through various food products on the basis of the measured content in plasma even though the toxicokinetic constants are unknown . however having in mind that a combined administration of ota and other mycotoxins such a pa often occurrs in the practice and synergistic effects between ota and the same mycotoxins are reported the lower contamination levels of ota in food feed would be also very dangerous for human and animal health 22 30 . cholestyramine in contrast to the nonspecific absorbent discussed above seems to be an effective absorbent of ota in the gastrointestinal tract of nonruminant animals . the contamination levels of ota in liver muscles and fat tissues of pigs can be easily found using the following experimental calculations by 1990 at least nine countries have regulations for ota levels or had proposed and enforced official limits for ota . recently the terms ochratoxicosis and mycotoxic nephropathy are the most frequently used ones for describing this nephropathy . on the other hand european union decided on an official limit for ota in cereals designed for direct consuming of about 5 g kg . on the other hand aspergillus ochraceus probably is the most impotant producer of ota in tropical and semitropical areas 16 17 . on the other hand the low contamination levels of ota in pigs chicks feeds suggest a possible synergism between ota and other compounds produced by the same ochratoxinogenic fungi .", "statistical significance was accepted for p values of 0.05 . statistical significance was accepted for p

important to communicate early and tell them the staff at the ward about every need that the patient may have and not cover or exclude anything . in this study icu transitional care is defined as care provided before during and after the transfer of an icu patient to another care unit with the aim of ensuring minimal disruption and optimal care for the patient . the patient s pain relief and vital signs especially respiration and hemodynamic were the focus and a point of decision in how and when the patient could be transferred out of intensive care.the most important in the transfer process is that the patients vital signs are stable enough we observe this extremely carefully . if the transfer was not planned in advance this phase also included examining all the equipment that the patient still had and considering removing measurement and technology specific to intensive care and that were not wanted or needed at the general ward.i think it s easier when we have someone who is responsible and keeps up the documentation and prepares for discharge we really want the patient s record to be clear and that it is obvious what is planned . the nurses expressed that it also was vital that the physician at the ward checked out the ordinations and wrote an updated status in the patient s record so that they had a tool for managing their care.its not just that the patient must be in good condition when he or she is discharged from the icu the care must also continue with high quality at the general ward . most icu patients are fragile and a safe transfer that maintains patient safety was expressed as essential . patient safety and interaction with patient family environment and other team members are essential for icu transitional care . it was also considered essential and helpful if the patients got early and frequent physiotherapy at the icu.we help the patient to drink water which includes helping them grip the glass and set it to the mouth we have to tell them that everything is better than doing nothing you can do it in your own way . the nurses in this study expressed that early mobilization was felt important not least for the patients ability to do things for themselves and manage the upcoming care . the meeting was described in two ways at the icu or in the general ward depending on the patient s status . the staff described the coordination between the icu and the department to which the patient would be transferred as a foundation for collaboration especially when the patient had been cared for in the icu for a long time . the staff expressed that it was important prior to transfer to take time to assess and summarize the patient s discharge status and the different nursing phenomena and actions that had been or should be taken for the patient . that you try to focus on that this is an important positive sign that the patient has to be transferred at a ward emphasize that now is the worst of the crisis over collaboration was described by the staff as essential on the day of transfer and included negotiating a suitable time for transfer and facilitating the transfer for all involved staff members . the results show that the categories secure encourage and collaborate are strategies used in the three phases of the icu transitional care process before during and after transfer from the icu table 1 . the staff at the general ward considered it extremely important to have the opportunity to prepare when they were about to get a patient from the icu since it was often time consuming . the nurses expressed that if the patient had specific needs they must be planned for and taken care of a strategy to manage care must be prepared . the focus in this study was on how to organize patient transfer to the ward for further care and rehabilitation and not on patients transferred for palliative end of life care . one important part of icu transitional care is to promote patients self care capability and encourage patients autonomy . in the interviews one nurse described an example of adverse events related to a transfer well we do nt want something critical to happen during the transfer but i will always remember one time i got to get a patient from icu i directly saw that she was hugely fragile and wondered if we really should move her from icu . the results in this study showed that icu transitional care is a complex multidisciplinary process that involves collaboration both within the icu and within other units involved . the main category also illustrates that there is a three way interaction in the process between staff and patients families between different team members and involved units and between patient family and environment . in one of the hospitals patients were further followed up within postintensive care meetings after they had been discharged and left the hospital.we try to go up and visit the patient at the ward a few days after the transfer if we have time it s appreciated by both the patient and the staff since they may ask if there is something missed . the main category and the strategies also illustrated a three way interaction in the process between staff and patient families between team members and involved units and between patient family and environment . securing the patients care and preserving patient safety during icu transitional care one essential issue was to optimize the patient s vital functions prior to transfer a key component to minimize risk for adverse and readmissions which were commonly referred to in the interviews . this team included staff from the icu nurse physician who could initiate treatment for the patient at the ward or decide to readmit the patient to the icu again . this was described as extra important when the patient or the family was anxious or if the patient had been cared for in the icu for a long time and had extended needs . the most important in the transfer process is that the patients vital signs are stable enough we observe this extremely carefully . we try to go up and visit the patient at the ward a few days after the transfer if we have time it s appreciated by both the patient and the staff since they may ask if there is something missed . depending on diagnosis this ability differed but the ward nurses expressed that the care in the icu often made patients immobilized and used to others taking care of their hygiene . collaborating and arranging a pretransfer meeting between ward staff and the patients and their families before transfer was expressed as one appreciated strategy . it took some time to establish hope and courage and some were more difficult than others.the patients and their families can be in a shock reaction when they arrive and they still try to process and understand what happened according to my experience this is more often seen if the intensive period were short . it was important to adjust and customize the information to the specific patient needs and inform the families about time for the upcoming transfer . discharge planning in general is described as a process which should provide continuity of care for patients . the icu and general ward staff expressed that anxiety could be minimized if patients and their families were encouraged and informed repeatedly that their condition was stabilized and that a transfer would soon occur . when the patient arrived at the general ward the staff stated that it was important to get a grip of the whole situation and to take charge of the patient . one icu nurse said it is important to communicate early and tell them the staff at the ward about every need that the patient may have and not cover or exclude anything . to secure patient care and to prevent adverse events later in the icu transitional care process it was necessary to reduce technology and adjust how medication was administrated . the ward nurses meant that this pretransfer meeting was valuable for them and for the patient since it was an opportunity to create a contact with the patient and family before transfer .", "a directly interacted with microglial

patients is significantly different form that of healthy controls hc . the strongest difference was observed with the significant increase in the bacteroides ssp . 2 built on microbiota based patient stratification will not only give insight into the observed microbiota heterogeneity among ibs patients as well as its partial overlap with healthy controls but also represents a concrete step toward improved diagnostics and novel treatment options with improved efficacy . figure 1.intestinal microbiota of pi ibs patients is significantly different form that of healthy controls hc . recently similar bacterial signatures have been also detected in subjects prior to gastroenteritis suggesting that perhaps the microbial composition already at the time of the initial infection predisposes certain subjects for pi ibs . interestingly both bacteroides fragilis and uncultured clostridiales have been identified as bistable microbial groups and predicted to act as tipping points of the gut ecosystem in opposite ways . this rank ordering reflected the patient s health status as it correlated with the increase of several immunological markers and intestinal complaints where as no such associations were observed when subdividing the patients according to their clinical status . to further analyze the crosstalk between the host and the microbiota we concentrated on the 27 bacterial taxa of imd and separately studied the associations between bacterial abundance and the host gene expression in mucosal surface of rectum the last part of large intestine . the most prominent negative correlation was observed between 7 bacteroides ssp and the expression of glycine serine and threonine metabolism pathway . this testifies for the robustness of these signatures in different cohorts and countries as well of the used microbial analysis pipeline . no single unifying cause for ibs has been reported but several factors have been associated with the disease etiology including genetic

reported to share some genetic alterations with idc 6 7 8 9 and to be found usually in the pancreas with idc 2 3 4 5 . it has also been reported that idc occurred in the remnant pancreas several years after partial pancreatectomy for high grade panin had been performed 4 5 . as the whole pancreas may be involved in the genetic alteration which is related to carcinogenesis it is not difficult to understand that panin occurs independently in different sites of the pancreas . histological examination revealed papillary growth of intraductal epithelia with significant nuclear atypia which was classified as panin3 according to the definition of the consensus guideline mainly in the branch ducts fig . pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia panin is a nomenclature for microscopic proliferative epithelial lesions of the pancreas which was proposed in 2001 by hruban et al . in this case pancreatic epithelial neoplasm itself was not identified in any radiological examinations and mucin production was not evident in pancreatic ductal epithelia by microscopic observation . it is well known that ipmn another precursor lesion of idc occurs multicentric . cytological examination of the

patients treated with this combination and found no instance of intracranial hemorrhage . as a result bevacizumab has a questionable impact on the overall survival of patients 3 4 . despite this radiosurgery intervention the patient continued to deteriorate neurologically and her deterioration was most likely caused by the microscopic invasive glioblastoma . patients treated with salvage chemotherapy had a response rate of only 9 and a median time to tumor progression ttp of 9 weeks . the resolution of our patient s cystic tumor is a notable response to novottf100a and bevacizumab after initial bevacizumab failure . here we report a patient who had failed bevacizumab therapy for a recurrent cystic glioblastoma and at the time of bevacizumab continuation received add on ttfields therapy by using the novottf100a device . second the slower growth rate of our patient s tumor may have helped to allow sufficient time for the ttfields to effect a treatment response . at the time of tumor recurrence this type of distant recurrence of glioblastoma could be the consequence of progressive development of the invasive phenotype intracranial inhomogeneity of the ttfields or incomplete coverage of certain parts of the brain by ttfields . although bevacizumab can offer a significantly higher response rate of 55 and a period of clinical stabilization with a median ttp of 26 weeks the tumor remains in the brain and continues to proliferate despite clinical and radiological appearances of improvement . reported only 8 of patients with a complete response while the majority had either a partial response 63 or no response 29 . last our patient s dexamethasone was completely discontinued 2 months after initiation of combination ttfields and bevacizumab therapy but a near complete resolution of gadolinium enhancement and a significant reduction of the cystic tumor were not detectable until 6 months into treatment . these data indicate that bevacizumab alone rarely results in a complete radiographic response and the partial response seen in a majority of patients suggests that there are probably multiple proangiogenic pathways activated in the glioblastoma . because ttfields interrupt tumor cells during mitosis and have no appreciable overlapping toxicity with bevacizumab we proceeded to add to her bevacizumab treatment ttfields therapy using the novottf100a device . a prior post hoc analysis of the response characteristics from the pivotal phase iii trial indicates that secondary glioblastomas as well as low or no dexamethasone usage are potentially important predictors of response in patients treated with the novottf100a device alone 7 17 . the addition of novottf100a to bevacizumab therapy in our patient appears to be safe and may provide added efficacy after initial incomplete response to bevacizumab alone . this is because the median time to response for ttfields therapy is longer than that for chemotherapies 8.4 versus 5.8 months respectively as noted in the prior post hoc response analysis . therefore allowing sufficient treatment time and removing dexamethasone are key parameters to maximize the probability of a response from ttfields .", "these chemicals mainly triclosan and chlorhexidine have been used as mouthrinses or added to dentifrices to avoid plaque formation and development of gingivitis10121422 . within the limits of this clinical study it may be concluded that the dentifrice containing aloe vera did not show any additional effect on plaque and gingivitis control compared to the fluoridated dentifrice . the test group used a herbal dentifrice containing aloe vera forever bright forever living products tempe az usa and the control group used a fluoridated dentifrice sorriso dentes brancos kolynos do brasil so paulo sp brazil with no antiinflammatory properties but with color and taste similar to those of the test dentifrice . although the manufacturer does not inform the concentration of aloe vera in the product used in the present study the percentage of therapeutic agent in a dentifrice usually range from 0.4 to 1.0 of the total formulation6 which was probably the concentration used in our study and could explain those results . the antimicrobial effect of a dentifrice containing aloe vera has been demonstrated in an in vitro study in which this phytotherapic agent inhibited the growth of diverse oral microorganisms such as s. mutans s. sanguis a. viscosus and c. albicans 7 . subjects with medical disorders or probing depth 3 mm individuals under antimicrobial therapy at least 1 month prior to the study and using mouthrinses or dentifrices containing substances with antiinflammatory properties as well as smokers and pregnant women were excluded from the trial . to the present date there is no reported controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a dentifrice containing aloe vera in the control of plaque and gingivitis . to the best of our knowledge the present study is the first report about effect of a dentifrice containing aloe vera on gingivitis . therefore the purpose of the present study was to assess the antiplaque and antigingivitis effects of this phytotherapic agent compared to a fluoridated dentifrice . there was a significant reduction of dentifrice tube weights between days 0 and 30 in both groups p0.001 which indirectly indicated that the

lesions from the breast or colon are most likely to mimic mucinous carcinoma of the skin .", "these features suggested that the tumor deposit in the fat was likely due to tumor seeding rather than a metastasis and that the tumor seeding could have resulted from the needle biopsy . although it is interesting to note that a coaxial needle was not used in any of the currently reported cases of needle tract seeding after renal mass biopsy table 1 there are just too few cases to establish a firm relationship between the risk of biopsy tract seeding and the use of a coaxial needle . time to presentation or diagnosis of tumor seeding after renal mass biopsy has ranged from 24 days to 84 months in previously reported cases where tumor seeding was not found on the initial histopathological analysis table 1 . as was seen with this case the biopsy needle traversed skin subcutaneous tissue multiple muscle and fascia layers and perinephric fat before reaching the renal lesion fig . in conclusion a common feature in all reported cases of needle tract seeding from a renal mass biopsy is that a coaxial needle was not used .", ". figure 7b shows that the surface viscosity s of dppc chol monolayers decreases exponentially with increasing cholesterol fraction at a given surface pressure . this linear relationship between d11 and is the same for changes in cholesterol fraction and surface pressure which suggests that the local alkane packing of dppc does not change with added cholesterol but that both surface pressure and cholesterol act to decrease the mismatch between the lipid headgroup and tailgroup area in the same way . in summary gixd shows that increasing the chol fraction at constant surface pressure or increasing the surface pressure at constant chol fraction decreases the tilt of the dppc lattice while leaving the alkane chains close packed with an invariant area per molecule normal to the alkane chain direction . b the surface viscosity of dppc chol monolayers measured with a microbutton magnetic rheometer decreases exponentially with cholesterol fraction for a given surface pressure for small mole fractions of cholesterol then plateaus in the same fashion as l02 . cholesterol and surface pressure influence the lattice in a similar way the same linear relationship between d11 and the tilt angle holds over the range of surface pressures and cholesterol fractions examined figure 4 . d11 decreases with increasing surface pressure and cholesterol fraction . decreases with increasing surface pressure and with some scatter increasing cholesterol fraction from 35 for pure dppc at 20 mn m to 18 for 7 mol chol at 40 mn m . in 2dimensions the diffusivity and free area can be related to the surface viscosity s via the saffmann delbrck model for a cylinder diffusing within a viscous monolayer surrounded by a viscous subphase to give an equation analogous to eq 3 in terms of the free area5from fitting dppc viscosity data we found that a0 40 which is roughly equal to ab cos the molecular area of a dppc molecule in a close packed untilted lattice table 2 . the cholesterol content of ards patients shows an increase in cholesterol content and in vitro cholesterol levels greater than 10 mol increase the minimum surface tension at monolayer collapse which may exacerbate lung damage . increasing the surface pressure provides a uniform compression of the dppc headgroup which results in a decrease in the headgroup chain incompatibility and hence the tilt without altering the alkane chain packing . c free area model for dppc chol monolayers eqs 6 8 provides an excellent correlation between the surface viscosity and the number of correlated molecules l02l11ab over the entire range of cholesterol fraction . to better compare the data at different surface pressures the surface viscosity and correlated area are normalized relative to a reference composition xref at the same 8refxref is the surface viscosity and l02l11abref is the number of molecules in the coherence area at xref taken to be pure dppc for 20 and 30 mn m and 0.4 chol for 40 mn m . the area per alkane chain perpendicular to the alkane chains 20.5 0.3 ab cos 2 is constant within the experimental error for all surface pressures and also for all cholesterol fractions . most important to the monolayer dynamics the extent of order or the number of correlated molecules decreases with increasing cholesterol fraction at all surface pressures suggesting an increased number of lattice defects that create free area for visco diffusive transport . we show that a simple model that proposes that the free area available for visco diffusive transport is inversely proportional to the number of correlated molecules which collapses the surface viscosity data for all surface pressures and cholesterol fractions onto a single universal curve . l02 for 40 mn m has more scatter and is nonmonotonic with cholesterol fraction likely the result of film instabilities due to trough leakage and monolayer collapse at higher surface pressure . this suggests that the decreased molecular ordering caused by the incompatibility of cholesterol with the alkane chain lattice is the origin of the orders of magnitude decrease in surface viscosity . figure 1 shows the gixd intensity maps for a pure dppc at 20 mn m and b 6.4 mol chol dppc monolayers at 40 mn m . fluorescence images figure 6 at the coexistence surface pressure 910 mn m show that increasing chol leads to a dramatic decrease in the width of the domains which means a large decrease in . molecular tilt angle measured from the monolayer normal decreases in the same manner with increasing cholesterol fraction as with increasing surface pressure over this range of sin tilt tilt to convert to degrees of tilt 180tilt . this is consistent with a decrease in tilt which decreases d11 while the alkane chain packing normal to the chain axis hence d02 remains the same . the maximum surface viscosity that we could measure with our rheometer was 100 pams the surface viscosity of pure dppc at 40 mn m was greater than this and was not measured . adding cholesterol decreases l02l11ab to 100 thereby increasing the free area per molecule to 1530 resulting in the dramatic decrease in surface viscosity . adding cholesterol does not change the local hexagonal dppc chain packing but does reduce the molecular tilt suggesting that cholesterol relieves some of the packing frustration between the dppc headgroup and tailgroups . in terms of measured experimental properties the surface loss modulus g is the out of phase component of the rotational resistance the surface storage modulus g is in the in phase component as in conventional 3d rheology figure 6b . our previous work has shown that the surface viscosity of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine dppc monolayers decreases by an order of magnitude per wt cholesterol up to about 3 wt suggesting that the cholesterol containing infasurf would have significantly different monolayer dynamics than cholesterol free survanta and curosurf . although the shape of cholesterol can relieve the frustration between the area of the headgroup and alkane chains of dppc the sterol rings can not efficiently pack into the alkane chain lattice . for pure dppc d11 decreases from 4.79 to 4.58 as the surface pressure increases from 20 to 40 mn m d02 is constant at 4.30 table 1 . for a 2dimensional film of constant thickness l4 in analogy to the free volume af a0 in which a is the area per molecule determined at a surface pressure from a surface pressure area isotherm and a0 is taken to be a fitting parameter . the combination of the sterol rings of chol and more disordered dppc chains gives the nanodomain phase excess tailgroup area which may relieve part of the packing frustration of the headgroups in the adjacent ordered dppc domains albeit at longer range than if the cholesterol intercalated within the dppc lattice . d normalizing to a reference state taken to be that of pure dppc for 20 and 30 mn m and 0.4 chol for 40 mn m surface pressures collapses the data onto a single universal curve relating surface viscosity to the molecular organization . pure chol has an untilted hexagonal lattice with a d spacing of 5.7 and an area per molecule of 35 much larger than the 20.5 area per alkane chain we measure . as is the case for other lipids accommodation of the larger dppc headgroup area occurs by dilation of the alkane chain area via an increase in the tilt angle . in previous work we found that the exponential dependence of surface viscosity on surface pressure was well correlated by a free area the free volume model was developed to explain the divergence in the viscosity of a liquid at the glass transition . this leads to a second type of frustration the decrease in tilt due to the accommodation of the area mismatch results in disrupting the alkane chain lattice which is likely higher in energy than decreasing the tilt . grazing incidence x ray diffraction gixd shows that up to 7 mol added cholesterol does not change the basic alkane packing of dppc but does decrease the extent of ordering or coherence area suggesting an increased number of lattice defects . this mismatch requires the tailgroup lattice to dilate which responds by the lower energy tilt deformation in order to fill space efficiently . figure 3a shows that at a fixed surface pressure adding chol decreases d11 while figure 3b shows that d02 remains constant . from the rotational resistance the linear viscoelastic surface moduli were obtained from the solution of the hydrodynamic problem of a rotating cylinder within a viscoelastic monolayer atop a viscous subphase . at 40 mn m l02 does not monotonically decrease with cholesterol fraction the scatter in l02 is much greater than at lower surface pressures and l02 is always less than expected from the results for the lower surface pressures . with some scatter the tilt decreases with increasing cholesterol fraction . a d11 and b d02 as a function of cholesterol and surface pressure . molecular defects and the associated decrease in domain size caused by the incompatibility of cholesterol packing into the alkane chain lattice enhance visco diffusive transport in monolayers . we postulate that the free area available for diffusive transport in a two dimensional analog of the classic cohen and turnbull free volume model of viscosity is inversely proportional to the number of molecules in a coherence area . two dimensional x ray maps of a pure dppc at 20 mn m and b 6.4 mol chol in dppc at 40 mn m . l02 decreases significantly with cholesterol fraction but is less affected by surface pressure . fluorescence images of dppc monolayers with 0.0 0.2 and 0.4 mol cholesterol at coexistence between the disordered le light and ordered lc dark phases at 10 mn m . hence the dppc cholesterol monolayer is better described as a nanostructured single phase monolayer rather than a mixture of two distinct phases similar to recently proposed two dimensional microemulsions . surface viscosity for pure dppc at 40 mn m was too high for the viscometer to measure . regardless of composition or surface pressure all ordered areas in the monolayers had the same distorted hexagonal packing with nn tilt figure 3b inset . is the tilt angle of the alkane chains in degrees with respect to the water surface tan qzq112 q022 from table 1 see inset to figure 3b . as such this system is analogous to 3d nanostructured surfactant oil water bicontinuous microemulsions or copolymer systems that separate into nanometer scale regions more enriched in one or the other monomer which are considered single phase . this confirms afm images that show cholesterol does not intercalate homogeneously into the dppc lattice but is expelled to disordered nanodomains that break up the dppc domains . the continuous fluid lipid phase appears bright due to the preferential segregation of the texas red dye while the better ordered domains exclude the dye molecules and appear dark . using this relationship the surface viscosity data for all surface pressures and cholesterol fractions collapses to a simple logarithmic relation with no adjustable parameters . figure 5 shows afm images of dppc chol monolayers transferred to mica substrates at 20 mn m showing two distinct morphologies . this change in tilt causes a decrease in the area per dppc molecule at the air water interface from 49.9 1 to 43.9 1 . for both 20 and 30 mn m l02 decreases monotonically with increasing cholesterol fraction to 20 lattice repeats but l11 only decreases to 10 lattice repeats . a dichroic mirror barrier filter assembly directed the excitation light onto the monolayer films at a normal angle of incidence and filtered the emitted light and the images were detected by a silicon intensified ccd camera . each molecule has a minimum van der waals volume v0 and moves randomly with thermal velocity u within confining cages of diameter d0 defined by its nearest neighbors .", "furthermore improving the cooperative mutual

permits parathyroid tissue to be stored for potential reimplantation thereby avoiding the risk of needlessly implanting parathyroid tissue during initial surgery . immediate autotransplantation of

functionality of the parathyroid graft is determined by their pth levels independent of calcium and vitamin d supplementation since most renal patients require supplementation table 2 . subsequent operations increase the risk of permanent aparathyroidism an outcome that cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue may prevent . cryopreservation of their parathyroid tissue is especially important because the long term renal effect of prolonged shpt and thpt predisposes patients to transient hypocalcemia from bone hunger . most commonly at risk are patients with multigland parathyroid hyperplasia especially those with familial primary hyperparathyroidism . during reoperations for thyroid cancer a portion of any inadvertently removed or devascularized parathyroid glands should be sent for cryopreservation before any immediate autotransplant . both a subtotal parathyroidectomy and a total parathyroidectomy can result in aparathyroidism so cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue is recommended at the time of the initial surgery . the last component of the storage medium is either a 10 to 30 autologous serum 2 10 11 15 16 or a 10 to 20 fetal bovine serum 4 11 . in the hands of experienced endocrine surgeons the risk is particularly low in patients with sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism phpt most of whom have a single parathyroid adenoma . yet other studies demonstrated that even though the percentage of viable cells did not necessarily differ between fresh and cryopreserved tissue cryopreservation decreased the total number of live cells by 70 . the vials containing the parathyroid tissue designated for delayed autotransplantation are removed from the liquid nitrogen freezer and placed in a warm water bath . moreover such patients may require multiple operations to prevent aparathyroidism as a consequence of the initial or subsequent operations cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue is recommended . routine central neck dissections for thyroid cancer have a complication rate of permanent hypoparathyroidism of up to 14 . recently other authors reported that the cryopreservation process decreased total cell viability and that decreased cell viability was associated with increased storage time . other authors recommend rinsing the fragments five times in 1 ml of rpmi 1640 solution with a 20 autologous serum . the typical freezing medium contains roswell park memorial institute rpmi 1640 solution 2 4 6 10 1316 . such patients may undergo either a subtotal 3.5gland parathyroidectomy or a total parathyroidectomy with an immediate autotransplant . an immediate autotransplant is preferred during thyroid surgery yet cryopreservation of a portion of the parathyroid tissue can also greatly help patients at high risk of undergoing further surgery .", "therefore assuming total costs are the sum of outpatient costs and inpatient costs inpatient costs are specifically the cost function is evaluated at the actual level of outpatient visits and at zero outpatient visits . the results of the estimated cost functions were used to disaggregate total costs into inpatient and outpatient components . in this section we describe a procedure for disaggregating total costs into inpatient and outpatient components which includes an estimable multiple output cost function . because our major objective is to disaggregate total costs into inpatient and outpatient components the function to be estimated is a total cost function . because the ratio of outpatient to inpatient costs remained relatively steady and the ratio of outpatient visits to discharges rose it follows that the ratio of the average incremental cost of an outpatient visit to the average cost of a discharge fell . a useful procedure for detecting this violation of ols assumptions in the case of a multiple output cost function is the park glejser test see vitaliano 1987 for another application of this test to a hospital cost function . outpatient costs are the incremental costs incurred as a result of outpatient activity where oc represents outpatient costs tc represents total costs dis and opv represent the number of discharges and outpatient visits respectively and x is a vector of exogenous variables . this is accomplished through estimation of a multiple output total cost function for a sample of acute care hospitals for the years 1984 88 . calculation of the incremental cost of outpatient activity also requires that the cost function be evaluated at a level of zero outpatient visits for each hospital . the results of the cost function disaggregation procedure indicate that the growth rate of outpatient costs did not differ substantially from that of inpatient costs despite considerable differences in the relative utilization patterns and revenue components . the decline in the outpatient inpatient unit cost ratio offset the increase in the ratio of outpatient visits to inpatient discharges . our service index approach to economies of scope differs from that of grannemann brown and pauly 1986 who include interaction terms between output pairs .", ". . . as shown in table 3 although there was no significant difference

", " objectiveit has been proposed that skeletal muscle insulin resistance arises from the accumulation of intramyocellular lipid metabolites that impede insulin signaling , including diacylglycerol and ceramide . \n we determined the role of de novo ceramide synthesis in mediating muscle insulin resistance.research design and methodsmice were subjected to 12 weeks of diet - induced obesity ( dio ) , and then treated for 4 weeks with myriocin , an inhibitor of serine palmitoyl transferase-1 ( spt1 ) , the rate - limiting enzyme of de novo ceramide synthesis.resultsafter 12 weeks of dio , c57bl/6 mice demonstrated a doubling in gastrocnemius ceramide content , which was completely reversed ( 141.5  15.8 vs. 94.6  10.2 nmol / g dry wt ) via treatment with myriocin , whereas hepatic ceramide content was unaffected by dio . \n interestingly , myriocin treatment did not alter the dio - associated increase in gastrocnemius diacyglycerol content , and the only correlation observed between lipid metabolite accumulation and glucose intolerance occurred with ceramide ( r = 0.61 ) . \n dio mice treated with myriocin showed a complete reversal of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance which was associated with enhanced insulin - stimulated akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3 phosphorylation . \n furthermore , myriocin treatment also decreased intramyocellular ceramide content and prevented insulin resistance development in db / db mice . finally , myriocin - treated dio mice displayed enhanced oxygen consumption rates ( 3,041  124 vs. 2,407  124 \n ml / kg / h ) versus their control counterparts.conclusionsour results demonstrate that the intramyocellular accumulation of ceramide correlates strongly with the development of insulin resistance , and suggests that inhibition of spt1 is a potentially promising target for the treatment of insulin resistance . ", " objectivealthough advanced age is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes , a clear understanding of the changes that occur during middle age that contribute to the development of skeletal muscle insulin resistance is currently lacking . \n therefore , we sought to investigate how middle age impacts skeletal muscle fatty acid handling and to determine how this contributes to the development of diet - induced insulin resistance.research design and methodswhole - body and skeletal muscle insulin resistance were studied in young and middle - aged wild - type and cd36 knockout ( ko ) mice fed either a standard or a high - fat diet for 12 weeks . \n molecular signaling pathways , intramuscular triglycerides accumulation , and targeted metabolomics of in vivo mitochondrial substrate flux were also analyzed in the skeletal muscle of mice of all ages.resultsmiddle-aged mice fed a standard diet demonstrated an increase in intramuscular triglycerides without a concomitant increase in insulin resistance . \n however , middle - aged mice fed a high - fat diet were more susceptible to the development of insulin resistance  a condition that could be prevented by limiting skeletal muscle fatty acid transport and excessive lipid accumulation in middle - aged cd36 ko mice.conclusionour data provide insight into the mechanisms by which aging becomes a risk factor for the development of insulin resistance . \n our data also demonstrate that limiting skeletal muscle fatty acid transport is an effective approach for delaying the development of age - associated insulin resistance and metabolic disease during exposure to a high - fat diet .

", " due primarily to the increasing shortage of allogeneic donor organs , xenotransplantation has become the focus of a growing field of research . \n currently , micropigs are the most suitable donor animal for humans . however , no standard method has been developed to evaluate the systemic vascular anatomy of micropigs and standard reference values to aid in the selection of normal healthy animals as potential organ donors are lacking . using 64-channel multidetector row computed tomographic angiography ( mdcta ) , we evaluated morphological features of the major systemic vessels in micropigs and compared our results to published human data . \n the main vasculature of the animals was similar to that of humans , except for the iliac arterial system . \n however , diameters of the major systemic vessels were significantly different between micropigs and humans . \n specifically , the diameter of the aortic arch , abdominal aorta , external iliac artery , and femoral artery , were measured as 1.50  0.07 cm , 0.85  0.06 cm , 0.52  0.05 cm , and 0.48  0.05 cm , respectively , in the micropigs . \n this mdcta data for micropig major systemic vessels can be used as standard reference values for xenotransplantation studies . \n the use of 64-channel mdcta enables accurate evaluation of the major systemic vasculature in micropigs . ", " amide hydrogen / deuterium exchange ( h / d exchange ) coupled with mass spectrometry has been widely used to analyze the interface of protein - protein interactions , protein conformational changes , protein dynamics and protein - ligand interactions . \n h / d exchange on the backbone amide positions has been utilized to measure the deuteration rates of the micro - regions in a protein by mass spectrometry1,2,3 . \n the resolution of this method depends on pepsin digestion of the deuterated protein of interest into peptides that normally range from 3 - 20 residues . \n although the resolution of h / d exchange measured by mass spectrometry is lower than the single residue resolution measured by the heteronuclear single quantum coherence ( hsqc ) method of nmr , the mass spectrometry measurement in h / d exchange is not restricted by the size of the protein4 . \n h / d exchange is carried out in an aqueous solution which maintains protein conformation . we provide a method that utilizes the maldi - tof for detection2 , instead of a hplc / esi ( electrospray ionization)-ms system5,6 . \n the maldi - tof provides accurate mass intensity data for the peptides of the digested protein , in this case protein kinase pak2 ( also called -pak ) . \n proteolysis of pak 2 is carried out in an offline pepsin digestion . \n this alternative method , when the user does not have access to a hplc and pepsin column connected to mass spectrometry , or when the pepsin column on hplc does not result in an optimal digestion map , for example , the heavily disulfide - bonded secreted phospholipase a2 ( spla2 ) . \n utilizing this method , we successfully monitored changes in the deuteration level during activation of pak2 by caspase 3 cleavage and autophosphorylation7,8,9 . ", " according to a patient - centered viewpoint , the meaning of harmonization in the context of laboratory medicine is that the information should be comparable irrespective of the measurement procedure used and where and/or when a measurement is made . \n harmonization represents a fundamental aspect of quality in laboratory medicine as its ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through the provision of an accurate and actionable laboratory information . \n although the initial focus has to a large extent been to harmonize and standardize analytical processes and methods , the scope of harmonization goes beyond to include all other aspects of the total testing process ( ttp ) , such as terminology and units , report formats , reference intervals and decision limits , as well as tests and test profiles request and criteria for interpretation . \n two major progresses have been made in the area of harmonization in laboratory medicine : first , the awareness that harmonization should take into consideration not only the analytical phase but all steps of the ttp , thus dealing with the request , the sample , the measurement , and the report . \n second , as the processes required to achieve harmonization are complicated , a systematic approach is needed . \n the international federation of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine ( ifcc ) has played a fundamental and successful role in the development of standardized and harmonized assays , and now it should continue to work in the field through the collaboration and cooperation with many other stakeholders . ", " type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder that develops as a result of relatively inappropriate insulin secretion and insulin resistance . increased levels of free fatty acids ( ffas ) are one of the important factors for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and contribute to defective -cell proliferation and increased -cell apoptosis . \n recently , glucagon - like peptide-1 ( glp-1 ) receptor agonists have been shown to possess an antiapoptotic effect , by increasing -cell mass and improving -cell function . \n however , their effects on -cells in vitro against lipotoxicity have not been elucidated completely . in this study \n , we investigated whether the glp-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 displays prosurvival effects in pancreatic -cells exposed to chronic elevated ffas . \n results showed that exendin-4 inhibited apoptosis induced by palmitate in min6 cells . \n after 24  h of incubation , exendin-4 caused rapid activation of extracellular signal - related kinase 1/2 ( erk1/2 ) under lipotoxic conditions . \n the erk1/2 inhibitor pd98059 blocked the antilipotoxic effect of exendin-4 on min6 cells . \n exendin-4 also inhibited the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis . \n this inhibition is associated with upregulation of bcl-2 . \n our findings suggested that exendin-4 may exert cytoprotective effects through activation of erk1/2 and inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway . ", " ribonucleic acids ( rna ) are hypothesized to have preceded their derivatives , deoxyribonucleic acids ( dna ) , as the molecular media of genetic information when life emerged on earth . \n molecular biologists are accustomed to the dramatic effects a subtle variation in the ribose moiety composition between rna and dna can have on the stability of these molecules . while dna is very stable after extraction from biological samples and subsequent treatment , rna is notoriously labile . the short half - life property , inherent to rna , benefits cells that do not need to express their entire repertoire of proteins . \n the cellular machinery turns off the production of a given protein by shutting down the transcription of its cognate coding gene and by either actively degrading the remaining mrna or allowing it to decay on its own . \n the steady - state level of each mrna in a given cell varies continuously and is specified by changing kinetics of synthesis and degradation . because it is technically possible to simultaneously measure thousands of nucleic acid molecules , \n these quantities have been studied by the life sciences community to investigate a range of biological problems . \n since the rna abundance can change according to a wide range of perturbations , this makes it the molecule of choice for exploring biological systems ; its instability , on the other hand , could be an underestimated source of technical variability . we found that a large fraction of the rna abundance originally present in the biological system prior to extraction was masked by the rna labeling and measurement procedure . \n the method used to extract rna molecules from cells and to label them prior to hybridization operations on dna arrays affects the original distribution of rna . \n only if rna measurements are performed according to the same procedure can biological information be inferred from the assay read out .

", " backgroundabnormal lipid levels are considered one of the most significant risk factors for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease , two of the main causes of death worldwide . \n apart from monogenic cases of hypercholesterolemia , most of the common dyslipidemias are caused by a number of low - impact polymorphisms . \n it has recently been reported that frequent polymorphisms at a large number of loci are significantly associated with one or more blood lipid parameters in many populations . \n identifying these associations in different populations and estimating the possible interactions between genetic models are necessary to explain the underlying genetic architecture of the associated loci and their ultimate impact on lipid - associated traits.methodswe estimated the association between 144 common single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) from published genome - wide association studies and the levels of total cholesterol , low- and high - density lipoprotein  cholesterol , and triglycerides in 1273 individuals from the genome database of the latvian population . \n we analyzed a panel of 144 common snps with illumina goldengate genotyping assays on the illumina beadxpress system.resultsten snps at the cetp locus and two at the mlxipl locus were associated with reduced high - density lipoprotein  \n cholesterol levels ; one snp at the tomm40 locus was associated with increased low - density lipoprotein  \n cholesterol ; and four snps at the mlxipl locus were associated with increased log triglyceride levels . \n there was also a significant correlation between the number of risk alleles and all the lipid parameters , suggesting that the coexistence of many low - impact snps has a greater effect on the dyslipidemia phenotype than the individual effects of found snps.conclusionwe conclude that the cetp , mlxipl , and tomm40 loci are the strongest genetic factors underlying the variability in lipid traits in our population .

", " purposewe investigated the feasibility of glaucoma detection by measuring retinal surface contour variability ( rscv ) using optical coherence tomography ( oct).methodsthe peripapillary region in one eye of each participant was scanned over an 8  8 mm area with a swept source oct prototype . \n the retinal surface contour was sampled at approximately 1.5- to 3.5-mm radius circles centered on the optic nerve head . \n the rscv is defined as the average log value within a middle spatial frequency band of the fourier transform to the elevation profile of the inner retinal surface . \n the spatial frequency band was optimized to distinguish glaucoma from normal . \n nerve fiber layer thickness ( nflt ) was sampled around a 1.7-mm radius circle . \n glaucoma severity was assessed by automated static perimetry.resultswe enrolled 17 glaucomatous eyes and 17 healthy eyes . \n a great majority of the glaucoma group were in the early stage ( visual field mean deviation average 2.48  3.73 db ) . \n significant differences were found for rscv between glaucoma and control eyes ( p < 0.003 ) at all radii . \n the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( aroc = 0.90 ) of rscv was best at the 3.5-mm radius . \n this was not significantly better than nflt ( aroc = 0.84 ) . with the 99% specificity , \n the glaucoma detection sensitivity was 53% for rscv and 29% for nflt \n ( p = 0.13).conclusionsretinal surface contour variability was significantly increased in glaucoma patients . \n the diagnostic accuracy of rscv was equal to nflt in early glaucoma . \n since the rscv detects small - scale focal damage and the average nflt measures global damage , they provide different diagnostic information that may be synergistic . ", " retained intraocular graphite foreign bodies are uncommon . \n although they are generally inert , they have been reported to cause severe inflammatory reaction and progressive damage to intraocular structures . \n we report a case of a six - year - old girl with a retained intraocular graphite pencil lead foreign body in the anterior chamber of the eye and discuss the various considerations in the management of such cases . ", " one of the room temperature ionic liquids ( rtils ) , 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ( [ bmim]cl ) was chosen to prepare the concentrated solutions of polyacrylonitrile ( pan ) . \n the rheological behaviors of the solutions were measured with rotational rheometry under different conditions , including temperatures , concentration , and molecular weight of pan . \n the solutions exhibited shear - thinning behaviors , similar to that of pan / dmf solutions . \n the viscosities decreased with the increasing of shear rates . \n however , the viscosity decreased sharply at high shear rates when the concentration was up to 16wt% . \n the dependence of the viscosity on temperature was analyzed through the determination of the apparent activation energy . \n unusually , the viscosity of solutions of higher concentration is lower than that of lower concentration . \n similarly , the viscosity of low molecular weight pan was higher than high molecular weight pan at high shear rates . \n the dynamic rheological measurement indicates the loss modulus is much higher than storage modulus . \n the trend of complex viscosity is similar with the result of static rheological measurement . \n the interaction between pan and ionic liquid [ bmim]cl was discussed . ", " we report two cases of esophagobronchial fistulae diagnosed by multi - detector computed tomography ( mdct ) oral contrast swallow examination . \n it is helpful to supplement the ct study with an oral contrast swallow as it aids in confirmation of a suspected fistula and also demonstrates the fistula tract better . \n we present the clinical details and the imaging findings on mdct of two cases of esophagobronchial fistulae  one secondary to chronic chest tuberculosis and the other secondary to a squamous cell carcinoma of the upper esophagus  followed by discussion of the etiology , pathogenesis , and imaging of these fistulae . ", " most guidelines for clinical practice , and especially those for the construction of decision support tools , assume that the individual person ( the patient ) needs to be in possession of information of particular sorts and amount in order to qualify as having made an  \n informed decision. this often implicitly segues into the patient having made a  \n good decision. in person - centred health care , whether , in what form , and with what weight ,  information is included as a criterion of decision quality is a matter for the person involved , to decide in the light of their own values , preferences , and time and resource constraints . ", " high - grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( panin-3 ) is recognized as a precursor lesion of invasive ductal carcinoma ( idc ) . \n however , histological evidence that panin-3 invades beyond the basement membrane of pancreatic ductal epithelium , that is , the moment panin-3 becomes idc , has not been captured yet . \n this may be because panins which are microscopic papillary or flat lesion rarely develop clinical symptoms and are not detectable on imaging examination . \n on the other hand , most idcs were found in the advanced stage with massive invasion . in this report \n , panin-3 obstructed several branch pancreatic ducts and subsequently caused pancreatitis which developed clinical symptom and was detectable as a pancreatic mass in imaging studies . \n a 65-year - old woman was referred to our institution for further examination of her repeated pancreatitis . \n abdominal ultrasound revealed a low echoic mass of 13 mm in diameter in the pancreatic body without upstream dilatation of the main pancreatic duct ( mpd ) . \n endoscopic retrograde pancreatography showed a strictured segment of 2 mm in length in the mpd at the pancreatic body . \n cytological examination of pancreatic juice revealed adenocarcinoma and distal pancreatectomy was performed . \n a resected specimen revealed a whitish mass of 15 mm in diameter in the pancreatic body , which was identified as pancreatitis by histological examination . \n papillary growth of panin-3 was seen mainly in the branch ducts . \n each panin-3 was located separately in the branch ducts with normal epithelia in the mpd between them . in three adjacent branch ducts , \n panin-3 was observed to be invading microscopically beyond the basement membrane . ", " ductal adenocarcinoma is an unusual variant of adenocarcinoma of the prostate . \n a 73-year - old male was referred to our hospital for the further examination of an elevated prostate - specific antigen level of 23.4 ng / ml . \n radical prostatectomy ( rp ) was performed based on the diagnosis obtained by a prostate needle biopsy . \n the rp specimen revealed ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate with positive capsular penetration . \n we herein report a rare case of ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate . ", " the novottf-100a device emits alternating tumor treating electric fields ( ttfields ) that interfere with cytokinesis and chromosome segregation during mitosis . \n because it has a similar efficacy to cytotoxic chemotherapy , the device has been approved by the united states food and drug administration for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma . \n although bevacizumab has been in use for recurrent glioblastoma , patients who experience incomplete or no response to bevacizumab may be predisposed to early bevacizumab treatment failure . \n however , the addition of ttfields therapy may augment the efficacy from bevacizumab . \n we report a patient with recurrent cystic glioblastoma who received add - on ttfields therapy due to an incomplete response to single - agent bevacizumab . \n after 6 cycles of therapy , a resolution of cystic enhancement was noted , together with reduction of the tumor cyst and resolution of most of the cerebral edema in the surrounding brain . \n however , the patient also suffered from relapsed disease at locations distant from the original glioblastoma and the corresponding radiation fields received at initial diagnosis . \n we conclude that combination ttfields and bevacizumab therapy is safe and may be efficacious for patients with recurrent glioblastoma . \n a further study would be needed to determine the relapse pattern and the distribution of the electric fields in the brain . ", " the effect of aloe vera on the reduction of plaque and gingivitis was evaluated in a randomized , parallel and double - blind clinical trial . \n subjects were randomly allocated to the test group ( n=15 )  dentifrice containing aloe vera - or the control group ( n=15 )  fluoridated dentifrice . plaque index ( pi ) and gingival bleeding index ( gbi ) \n were assessed at days 0 and 30 . \n subjects were asked to brush their teeth with the control or test dentifrice , three times a day , during a 30-day period . \n there was a significant reduction on plaque and gingivitis in both groups , but no statistically significant difference was observed among them ( p>0.01 ) . \n the dentifrice containing aloe vera did not show any additional effect on plaque and gingivitis control compared to the fluoridated dentifrice . ", " primary mucinous carcinoma of the skin is a rare adnexal tumor of sweat gland origin . \n a case report is presented of a 70-year - old male , who presented with a slow growing mass near the lateral canthus of his left eye . \n the case was clinically diagnosed as a fibroma . \n an excisional biopsy of the lesion revealed mucinous carcinoma of the skin . \n investigations excluded the possibility of metastatic mucinous carcinoma . \n thus , the lesion in the lateral canthus region was diagnosed as primary mucinous carcinoma of the skin , a rare site of occurrence . ", " a 66-year - old man underwent computed tomography - guided needle biopsy of a suspicious renal mass . \n two months later he underwent partial nephrectomy . \n histology revealed a 30-mm clear cell renal cell carcinoma , up to fuhrman grade 3 . \n an area of the capsule was interrupted , which corresponded to a hemorrhagic area on the cortical surface . under microscopy \n , this area showed a tongue of tumor tissue protruding through the renal capsule . \n a tumor deposit was found in the perinephric fat . \n these features suggest that tumor seeding may have occurred during the needle biopsy . ", " adding small fractions of cholesterol \n decreases the interfacial \n viscosity of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine ( dppc ) monolayers by an \n order of magnitude per wt % . \n grazing incidence x - ray diffraction shows \n that cholesterol at these small fractions does not mix ideally with \n dppc but rather induces nanophase separated structures of an ordered , \n primarily dppc phase bordered by a line - active , disordered , mixed \n dppc - cholesterol phase . \n we propose that the free area in the classic \n cohen and turnbull model of viscosity is inversely proportional to \n the number of molecules in the coherence area , or product of the two \n coherence lengths . \n cholesterol significantly reduces the coherence \n area of the crystals as well as the interfacial viscosity . using this \n free area collapses the surface viscosity data for all surface pressures \n and cholesterol fractions to a universal logarithmic relation . \n the \n extent of molecular coherence appears to be a fundamental factor in \n determining surface viscosity in ordered monolayers . ", " abstractbackgroundthe centralization of human activities is associated with different pollutants which enter into environment easily and cause the urban environment more vulnerable . regarding the importance of air pollution issue for tehran metropolis , many plans and regulations have been developed . however , most of them failed to decline the pollution . \n the purpose of this study was to pathologically analyze air - pollution control plans to offer effective solutions for tehran metropolis.methodsa qualitative content analysis in addition to a semi - structured interview with 14 practicing professional were used to identify 1 ) key sources of tehran s air pollution , 2 ) recognize challenges towards effective performance of pertinent plans and 3 ) , offer effective solutions.resultsrelated challenges to air - pollution control plans can be divided into two major categories including lack of integrated and organized stewardship and pest challenges.conclusionfor controlling the air pollution of tehran effectively , various controlling alternatives were identified as systematization of plan preparation process , standardization and utilization of new technologies & experts , infrastructural development , realization of social justice , developing coordination mechanisms , improving citizens participatory capacity and focusing on effective management of fuel and energy.controlling air pollution in tehran needs a serious attention of policymakers to make enforcements through applying a systemic cycle of preparation comprehensive plans . \n further , implement the enforcements and evaluate the environmental impact of the plans through involving all stakeholders . ", " chiari malformation type i ( cm - i ) related to syndromic craniosynostosis in pediatric patients has been well - studied . \n the surgical management consists of cranial vault remodeling with or without posterior fossa decompression . \n there were also cases , in whom cm - i was diagnosed prior to the craniosynostosis in early childhood . \n we present a 16-year - old boy who admitted with symptoms related to cm - i . with careful examination and further genetic investigations , \n a diagnosis of crouzon syndrome was made , of which the patient and his family was unaware before . \n the patient underwent surgery for posterior fossa decompression and followed - up for crouzon 's syndrome . to our knowledge , this is the only case report indicating a late adolescent diagnosis of crouzon syndrome through clinical symptoms of an associated cm - i . ", " the risk of permanent hypoparathyroidism following thyroid and parathyroid surgery is around 1% in the hands of experienced endocrine surgeons .   \n although this complication is rare , rendering a patient permanently aparathyroid has significant consequences on the health and quality of life of the patient . \n immediate autotransplantation of parathyroid glands that are injured or unintentionally removed offers the best possibility of graft viability and functionality . \n however , since the majority of cases of hypoparathyroidism are transient , immediate autotransplantation can complicate postoperative surveillance in certain patients , especially those with primary hyperparathyroidism .   \n cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue is an alternate technique that was developed to treat patients with permanent hypoparathyroidism . \n this method allows for parathyroid tissue to be stored and then autotransplanted in a delayed fashion once permanent hypoparathyroidism is confirmed . \n this article provides a contemporary review on cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue and its current role in thyroid and parathyroid surgery . ", " in this article , the authors estimate a multiple - output cost function for a sample of 2,235 hospitals during the period 1984 - 88 to disaggregate total costs into inpatient and outpatient components . \n the results suggest that outpatient cost growth is roughly proportional to that of inpatient cost , despite much higher relative growth in revenues and utilization on the outpatient side . \n the stability in the outpatient / inpatient cost ratio implies that the increase in the outpatient - to - inpatient utilization ratio was offset by a decline in their relative unit costs . ", " backgroundwilms tumor ( wt ) is the most common malignant renal tumor in children . \n previous studies suggested the reversion - inducing , cysteine - rich protein with kazal motifs ( reck ) down - regulation might have a role in numerous human cancers . \n the current study was done to investigate the associations of reck single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) with the wt susceptibility in chinese children.material/methodswe analyzed 2 snps ( rs10972727and rs11788747 ) in a total of 97 wt children and 194 healthy matched controls ( 1:2 ratio ) by real - time pcr and pcr - rflp genotyping analysis.resultswe found that the g allele of rs11788747 in the reck gene was significantly associated with wt in chinese children ( or=0.7 , 95% ci : 0.450.99 ; p=0.042 ) ; as with another snp rs10972727 , however , no statistically significant difference was detected . \n further analysis showed there was also a statistically significant difference in genotype frequencies between terminal tumor stage ( p=0.026 ) and metastatic groups ( p=0.002).conclusionsthe present data indicate that there is a significant association between mutant g of rs11788747 in reck and wt risk . \n g carriers with advanced tumor stage or with metastasis might have an increased risk of wt .
