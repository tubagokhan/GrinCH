deposition and reduced cognitive decline . in sum it appears that the preponderance of the data can be most consistently interpreted as showing that the brain inflammatory protein apoe plays a catalytic role in the ad ds amyloid cascade and consequent cognitive decline with binding and clearance differences between the apoe isoforms reflecting their differing abilities to bind to a and catalyze its conversion into neurotoxic macromolecular species figure 2 . all experiments carried out so far in vitro or in transgenic mice indicate that the ability of a to form neurotoxic filaments or oligomers and cause cognitive decline are increased in the presence of apoe particularly mouse apoe and human apoe4 with apoe2 being protective . similarly apoe particularly apoe4 has been shown to reduce the cell surface levels and function of nmda ampa and apoer2 receptors in neurons . finally the ability of a oligomers to inhibit key microtubule motors and prevent the transport of neurotrophin neurotransmitter and other receptors to the cell surface may underlie their neuronal toxicity . because of apoe s essential genetic and therefore presumably biochemical contribution to ad pathology and cognitive decline it is critical that its role in the ad pathogenic pathway amyloid cascade be elucidated in order for therapeutics based on apoe to be designed . if on the other hand apoe is involved in a clearance with human apoe4 being a greater inhibitor of clearance or poorer clearer then reducing apoe levels or apoe binding to a should increase amyloid deposition and cognitive decline . this latter finding can now be understood as potentially reflecting the ability of apoe4 to promote the conversion of endogenous neuronal a into oligomers which then inhibit mt based transport of key cellular components such as receptors to their functional location .", "vertebral compression fractures are the most common osteoporotic fractures with a greater incidence in

roles of inflammatory mirnas in mass maintenance and functional development of skeletal muscle still need to be further explored and confirmed . the chronic inflammatory aging process depends not only on increased expression of proinflammatory factors but also on reduced levels of anti inflammatory factors such as il10 one of the anti inflammatory cytokines . il6 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases including sarcopenia by regulating inflammatory and metabolic functions . in turn inflammation aggravates muscle loss and fat accumulation in the aging skeletal muscle and further decreases muscle function and physical activity . in order to elucidate which mirna is important in the production of proinflammatory cytokines in aging related muscle wasting mrna targets and specific roles in regeneration and protein synthesis in skeletal muscle need to be established . accumulating evidences over the past decade have demonstrated that those proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf il6 and c reactive protein crp cause a significant increase in aging skeletal muscle cells and play a key role in the complex network of inflammatory signals in charge of muscle homeostasis connected with aging related disability and mortality 31 32 . a comparative analysis of cytokine levels has confirmed the upregulation of proinflammatory il6 and crp in the elderly along with increased risk for the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength . during obesity adipose tissue is characterized by a chronic inflammatory state through the release of numerous

saudi arabia by aziz1 on 1046 patients has demonstrated that ramadan fasting itself does not pose a risk to human metabolism or health but conversely has beneficial health effects on physiological parameters eg an opportunity to lose weight and on chronic disease prevention . we will focus on the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes dpp4 inhibitors and the role of vildagliptin during ramadan fasting . a recent review published in switzerland and france has studied worldwide the role of dpp4 inhibitors including vildagliptin during ramadan fasting and has come to the conclusion that the anti diabetic agents dpp4 inhibitors could be a more safer option while managing type2 diabetes during ramadan fasting with a very low risk of hypoglycemia.47 another prospective noninterventional study published in france to assess real life rate of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting in patients with type 2 diabetes and their ongoing dual therapy of metformin vildagliptin or metformin sulfonylurea has shown that hypoglycemia as an adverse events aes was higher in su group as compared to vildagliptin group 17.9 vs 7.5 p0.025 and better compliance was seen with vildagliptin group.48 the virtue vildagliptin experience compared with sulphonylureas observed during ramadan study which recruited 1333 patients from 10 different countries worldwide has demonstrated significantly fewer hypoglycemia events as compared with su therapy 5.4 vs 19.8 respectively p0.001 . in type 1 diabetic subjects there is absolute insulin deficiency due to autoimmunity against cells with destruction of these cells as compared with type 2 diabetic subjects who exhibit relative insulin deficiency with insulin resistance.2526 furthermore absolute or relative hyperglucagonemia due to deficiency of incretin hormones in diabetic state is a hallmark of both type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects.2728 in other words in type 2 diabetic subjects there is insulin resistance and hyperglucagonemia . due to these pathophysiological states lipolysis and ketosis may worsen the metabolic state leading to diabetic ketoacidosis dka during prolonged fasting with absolute or relative insulin deficiency.2930 insulin resistance can be reversed by metformin and hyperglucagonemia by incretin based therapy . other studies have reported similar results when comparing ohas with vildagliptin.45 another study conducted on vildagliptin and sus or ohas during ramadan fasting has reported higher incidence of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting in the group treated with su and metformin vs vildagliptin plus metformin 26 episodes vs 19 episodes and also reported hba1c reduction in the vildagliptin group however with insignificant p values.46 a study conducted by aziz1 has also concluded that the patient group prescribed with dpp4 inhibitors such as sitagliptin vildagliptin did not show any episodes of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting . one of the interesting phenomena of dpp4 inhibitor or vildagliptin is that it is blood glucose dependent and does not cause hypoglycemia when given as monotherapy which is again a therapeutic advantage of dpp4 inhibitors vildagliptin during ramadan fasting . as the dpp4 inhibitors contrary to this normal physiology in diabetic patients the balance between insulin secretion and hepatic glucose production is dysregulated .", "2 . . etpd and ltpd

inhibited the binding of huly m13 to laccer dopc liposome coated and dopc laccer mixture coated plastic wells suggesting that huly m13 binds only to laccer clusters in laccer enriched microdomains . surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that reduction of the laccer content in the dopc cholesterol laccer sm lipid layer markedly decreased huly m13 but not t5a7 binding to laccer suggesting that the content of laccer in laccer enriched microdomains affects the binding avidity of huly m13 to laccer . in contrast the binding avidity of t5a7 to laccer coated plastic wells was much weaker than its binding avidity to dopc laccer popc laccer and dppc laccer mixture coated wells suggesting that the binding of t5a7 to laccer is affected by pc . laccer enriched microdomains are composed of laccer sm phospholipids and cholesterol . in contrast lactose inhibition of t5a7 binding to dopc laccer mixture coated plastic wells was significantly lower than its inhibition of huly m13 binding suggesting that t5a7 recognizes the pc enhanced three dimensional structure of laccer clusters . interestingly huly m13 but not t5a7 can be used for immunoprecipitation suggesting a difference in binding andor cluster formation of huly m13 and t5a7 to laccer enriched microdomains . thus huly m13 may bind to the core region of lactose clusters in laccer enriched domains while t5a7 binds to

healthful view of how obese individuals navigate their everyday lives this more in depth understanding may contribute invaluably to public health approaches in the future . applied social science can enhance obese individuals quality of life by providing a greater understanding and problematization of taken for granted assumptions regarding obese individuals health lives and lifestyles . as evidence suggests that obese individuals may be healthy obese individuals may not absorb popular obesity related messaging based on their own somatic signaling or knowledge of their lifestyles . regardless of the health risks associated with obesity a greater understanding of how obese individuals feel concerning their health and quality of life what obese individuals regard as their priorities concerning health and what they feel would most benefit their quality of life and wellness is necessary . this perspective would help counter potentially traumatic past experiences of

literature . given the commonly accepted threshold of 40000qaly this study demonstrated that compared to hf hd hdf is a cost effective treatment for patients on dialysis . several studies suggest that hdf may lead to better clinical results than high flux hd hf hd.23 according to a recent survey hdf was started to prevent dialysis complications increase the efficiency of dialysis for uremic accumulates treat dialysis related hypotension and dialysis related amyloidosis and for intractable pruritus restless leg syndrome and arthralgia not related to dialysis related amyloidosis.4 however to date randomized studies have not conclusively supported the superiority of hdf regarding clinical outcomes.57 in addition concerns have been raised about its cost utility8 leading investigators to conduct cost analyses to assess the differential expenditures between the two therapies.9 in a recent editorial vanholder et al concluded that more expensive therapies should be reimbursed only when evidence of their cost utility defined as the ratio of treatment cost to treatment outcome taking into consideration also the quality of life qol is sufficiently robust.10 the cost of hdf per se has decreased in recent years due to 1 increased market penetration and the subsequent economy of scale in the production of equipment and disposables 2 the pressure on health care costs due to the economic crises prevailing since 2008 and 3 the safety and reliability of online method that have reduced demand for microbiological testing and monitoring.1112 furthermore after the publication of the study of canaud et al2 hdf treatment effectiveness has increasingly been understood to be positively associated with the magnitude of the convection volume used resulting in trends toward the application of higher hdf convection volumes than were applied in earlier cost analyses . of note this meta analysis includes also the contrast study and our cost effectiveness analysis does include all the relevant randomized clinical trials . the icer estimates show a good value for money but some doubts about the cost effectiveness of hdf over hf hd remain due to the residual 20 probability of costs being higher andor benefits being lower with hdf . in this study as there are no other data about qol differences between hdf and hf hd in the literature these coefficients have been used in our simulation . additionally the lack of qol coefficients related to hf hd forced the use of data from a comparison of hdf with low flux hd.8 uncertainty around results is high but this is typical in

to increased pain in the insulin treatment group . patients with diabetes may face the difficult situation where tight blood glucose control can reduce the risk of diabetic complications however this

expandability hypothesis where the pathological expansion of abdominal adipose tissue in morbid obesity reaches a threshold characterized by an inability of adipose tissue to expand because its capacity to recruit new adipocytes is exhausted . we have suggested that the adipose tissue and the liver may act in a balanced manner depending on the ir status as a decrease in fabp4 expression was observed in adipose tissue from metabolically obese patients versus metabolically healthy humans while the opposite takes place in the liver with an increase in fabp4 expression in metabolically obese patients with the ir status being an important determinant in tissue expression . this is closely associated with the storage capacity in adipose and muscle tissues with the mismatch between energy surplus and storage capacity in adipose tissue and muscle tissues possibly being an important factor linking obesity and ir . on the other hand brca1 was found to be up regulated in adipose tissue from obese subjects independently of whether they had t2d so we suggest a crosstalk between brca1 lipogenesis adipogenesis obesity and obesity associated ir . recently we found an increase in proapoptotic casp37 gene expression and a decrease in antiapoptotic bcl2 gene expression in adipose tissue both vat and sat with the increase in body fat mass . however adipose tissue buffering is impaired in obesity through defects in the ability of adipose tissue to respond rapidly . but lipogenesis is not the only process involved other crucial processes for the normal function of the

produced how the virus is recognized and destroyed what countermeasures the viruses use and which non immunity processes crispr cas components participate in . another study on the same species demonstrated that in addition to the expected competition between crispr cas immunity and phage escape mutants there were some unanticipated results phages could establish themselves in a culture containing one but not 2 spacers targeting it bacteria without crispr cas immunity persist in cultures despite presence of a large amount of phage and bacteria with 2 spacers targeting a phage could still not establish themselves in a population of phage sensitive bacteria . microorganisms contain a variety of innate defense mechanisms such as preventing dna injection cleaving certain sequences using restriction modification systems preventing phage proliferation by bacteriophage exclusion and even committing altruistic suicide by abortive infection systems to prevent viruses to spread in a population . could the phage onslaught result in a diversity of crispr cas immunity sufficient to over power escape phage development the teams set up a study to examine the relationship between crispr diversity and the systems effectiveness by mixing and infecting cultures consisting of different number of clonal strains where each strain had a different spacer matching the phage but were otherwise identical . the authors conclude that for a full understanding of the interaction of phage and their host bacteria a model beyond a simple iterative process of crispr cas immunity and phages

promoter region dna sequences nxsensor analysis has demonstrated that the promoter regions of hk genes are likely to be relatively nucleosome free a finding that may help to explain the wide tissue distribution of their expression . in human dna most dna sequences are neutral or favorable to nucleosome formation but some sequences by virtue of their influence on the curvature and flexibility of the dna double helix 1213 are unfavorable to nucleosome formation we have called these nucleosome exclusion sequences nxss . figure 2 also shows that the mean number of nxss in this window for the hk genes was significantly higher than that expected for random sequence dna with the same base composition as the hk gene promoter regions 2.10 for hk genes 0.53 for the corresponding random sequence

sequences at least 50 bp in length likely to be nucleosome free . these two components of selection might be related in that the factors that regulate expression of hk genes may have evolved to bind

patterns among different tissues and were able to show in agreement with recent reports significant differences among promoter regions in the number and position of such sequences . this is in

fibrillogenesis depends on whether the mutant species generated by this process can acquire a misfolded state by themselves which will eventually act as a seed in the nucleation dependent aggregation process as seen for reported mutant syn proteins . the most frequent dna lesion generated by oxidative stress is 8oxo78dihydroguanine 8oxodg the oxidized form of guanine often associated with neurodegenerative diseases including pd and alzheimer s disease ad . together we propose a hypothetical model by which 8oxodg lesions in the protein coding region of snca could yield a small amount of tm protein species with higher aggregation propensity that potentially serve as a seeding for accelerating the aggregation of wild type syn leading to the self propagation of aggregates and causing degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway in pd figure 5 . 8oxodg the most frequent dna lesion caused by oxidative stress is often associated with neurodegenerative diseases including pd . as shown in syn a53 t mutant species that was reported in the familial form of pd the pathologically misfolded proteins drive the template directed misfolding of the native monomeric proteins which contributes to the nucleation dependent fibrillation process . if the 8oxodg mediated tm mutant species are more stable in the sheet form then a limited amount of tm species could be enough to promote prion like nucleation of syn . since a significant increase of 8oxodg was observed in the substantia nigra of patients with pd it is highly possible that tm event might significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of pd . immunocytochemical analysis of 8oxodg revealed a significant increase of this dna oxidation marker in the substantia nigra of patients with pd although the extent of nuclear 8oxodg accumulation is not as high as mitochondrial 8oxodg .", "in our study the improvement in static balance was attributed to the 8week pilates training course that improved muscle control of the

the risk of all grade hfs at 39 for patients treated with sorafenib.29 prophylactic treatment with urea based cream can decrease the incidence of or delay the development of hfs in patients receiving sorafenib.30 another meta analysis showed that all grade diarrhea occurred in 37 of patients treated with sorafenib for different types of tumors and can negatively impact quality of life.31 in addition to sorafenib several other kinase inhibitors have been studied for the treatment of advanced follicular origin radioiodine refractory thyroid cancer table 1 . in the expanded mtd cohort of 25

. patients may be stalled in suspended animation they are not alive in the sense the we enjoy life but neither are they able to die as long as nutrition hydration ventilation and perfusion are assured . accordingly some families feel that if life support systems can maintain vital signs for a day or a week then suspended animation should be possible indefinitely until a cure is found . however if organ system failure is not reversible then the reasoning behind life support technology becomes moot . in many cases reanimation of such patients this conundrum is created because we must be prepared to apply life sustaining technology to patients when the benefit appears to outweigh the risk and when there is a reasonable chance for an outcome that the patient would desire . if the patient can just be maintained comfortably for long enough then a cure may eventually become possible . there is a population of icu patients who will die no matter what treatment is rendered them .", "a follow

fetal genotype incompatibility is a risk factor specifically for males one would expect to observe that schizophrenia risk is associated with a birth order effect with male offspring exposed to rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility but not for female offspring . because risk of schizophrenia is associated with prenatal obstetric complications including preeclampsia and low birth weight maternal fetal hla matching has been associated with these and other pregnancy obstetric complications maternal fetal hla matching has been observed in another neurodevelopmental disorder and maternal fetal hla matching may occur more frequently in families of individuals with schizophrenia for biological reasons a candidate gene study was conducted to assess maternal fetal genotype incompatibility that is matching at the hla a b and drb1 loci as a risk factor of schizophrenia . thus one hypothesis is that specific schizophrenia effects of rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility hypoxia hyperbilirubinemia can affect female fetuses but that they are less likely to surpass the threshold of severity compared to male fetuses threshold effect . it is unlikely to be the case that rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility is more likely to occur in pregnancies with male offspring nor is there evidence that its related condition of hemolytic disease of the newborn is more likely to occur in pregnancies with male fetuses compared to female fetuses . however there is evidence that the clinical manifestations of rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility are more severe in pregnancies with male fetuses than with female fetuses . maternal fetal genotype incompatibility can occur when maternal and fetal genotypes differ for example rhd maternal fetal genotype incompatibility or when they are too similar for example hla b maternal fetal genotype incompatibility . the same hypothesis can be tested with hla b maternal fetal genotype incompatibility .", "total

japanese acupuncturists became familiar with nogiers reflex system . this chinese medical group verified the clinical effectiveness of the nogier approach and assessed the conditions of over 2000 clinical patients recording which ear points corresponded to specific diseases . nogier acknowledged that chinese traditional medicine had been using ear points for acupuncture prior to his discovery but these had been considered empirical points for particular treatments and were not associated with a somatotopic representation of the homunculus in the ear . dr nogier 2 originated the concept of an inverted fetus map on the external ear fig . being able to detect the vas on the radial pulse of the patients left hand enables the practitioner to precisely determine the location of a point whether there is a pathology in the region of the body that relates to specific points and whether certain substances are indicated . then dr nogier noticed that there was a distinct change in the amplitude and dimension of the pulse when certain points on the auricle were stimulated . to experimentally evaluate the claims by french and chinese ear acupuncture that a somatotopic mapping of the body was represented in the external ear 40 patients were examined to determine areas of their body where there was musculoskeletal pain . attending that congress was dr grard bachmann who published

to the risk of seeding malignant cells along the needle tract . several factors in theory could affect the risk of biopsy tract seeding such as needle size the number of needle passes and the use of a coaxial needle . however because of the paucity of cases there is currently no satisfactory association between the risk of needle tract seeding and needle size or the number of needle passes . it is also difficult because of underreporting to associate the risk of needle tract seeding with the number of needle passes through a tumor . although it is interesting to note that a coaxial needle was not used in any of the currently reported cases of needle tract seeding after renal mass biopsy table 1 there are just too few cases to establish a firm relationship between the risk of biopsy tract seeding and the use of a coaxial needle . use of a coaxial needle allows multiple passes through the renal mass with only one pass through the surrounding normal tissue . in conclusion a common feature in all reported cases of needle tract seeding from a renal mass biopsy is that a coaxial needle was not used .", ". figure 7b shows that the surface viscosity s of dppc chol monolayers decreases exponentially with increasing cholesterol fraction at a given surface pressure . in summary gixd shows that increasing the chol fraction at constant surface pressure or increasing the surface pressure at constant chol fraction decreases the tilt of the dppc lattice while leaving the alkane chains close packed with an invariant area per molecule normal to the alkane chain direction . this linear relationship between d11 and is the same for changes in cholesterol fraction and surface pressure which suggests that the local alkane packing of dppc does not change with added cholesterol but that both surface pressure and cholesterol act to decrease the mismatch between the lipid headgroup and tailgroup area in the same way . decreases with increasing surface pressure and

is preferred during thyroid surgery yet cryopreservation of a portion of the parathyroid tissue can also greatly help patients at high risk of undergoing further surgery . both a subtotal parathyroidectomy and a total parathyroidectomy can result in aparathyroidism so cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue is recommended at the time of the initial surgery . therefore cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue should be considered during parathyroid surgery when the iopth drop 80 . subsequent operations increase the risk of permanent aparathyroidism an outcome that cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue may prevent . cryopreservation permits parathyroid tissue to be stored for potential reimplantation thereby avoiding the risk of needlessly implanting parathyroid tissue during initial surgery . cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue rather than an immediate autotransplant allows the surgeon to appropriately predict surgical outcome the functionality of any remaining parathyroid tissue and the need for a delayed parathyroid autotransplant . moreover such patients may require multiple operations to prevent aparathyroidism as a consequence of the initial or subsequent operations cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue is recommended .", "therefore assuming total costs are the sum of outpatient costs and inpatient costs inpatient costs are specifically the

describe a procedure for disaggregating total costs into inpatient and outpatient components which includes an estimable multiple output cost function . outpatient costs are the incremental costs incurred as a result of outpatient activity where oc represents outpatient costs tc represents total costs dis and opv represent the number of discharges and outpatient visits respectively and x is a vector of exogenous variables . because the ratio of outpatient to inpatient costs remained relatively steady and the ratio of outpatient visits to discharges rose it follows that the ratio of the average incremental cost of an outpatient visit to the average cost of a discharge fell . the results of the cost function disaggregation procedure indicate that the growth rate of outpatient costs did not differ substantially from that of inpatient costs despite considerable differences in the relative utilization patterns and revenue components . this is accomplished through estimation of a

", " it is known that the brain adaptively recalibrates itself to small ( 100  ms ) auditory  visual ( av ) temporal asynchronies so as to maintain intersensory temporal coherence . \n here we explored whether spatial disparity between a sound and light affects av temporal recalibration . \n participants were exposed to a train of asynchronous av stimulus pairs ( sound - first or light - first ) with sounds and lights emanating from either the same or a different location . following a short exposure phase , \n participants were tested on an av temporal order judgement ( toj ) task . \n temporal recalibration manifested itself as a shift of subjective simultaneity in the direction of the adapted audiovisual lag . \n the shift was equally big when exposure and test stimuli were presented from the same or different locations . \n these results provide strong evidence for the idea that spatial co - localisation is not a necessary constraint for intersensory pairing to occur . ", " nucleosomes , a basic structural unit of eukaryotic chromatin , play a significant role in regulating gene expression . \n we have developed a web tool based on dna sequences known from empirical and theoretical studies to influence dna bending and flexibility , and to exclude nucleosomes . \n nxsensor ( available at ) finds nucleosome exclusion sequences , evaluates their length and spacing , and computes an  \n accessibility score giving the proportion of base pairs likely to be nucleosome - free . \n application of nxsensor to the promoter regions of housekeeping ( hk ) genes and those of tissue - specific ( ts ) genes revealed a significant difference between the two classes of gene , the former being significantly more open , on average , particularly near transcription start sites ( tsss ) . \n nxsensor should be a useful tool in assessing the likelihood of nucleosome formation in regions involved in gene regulation and other aspects of chromatin function . ", " mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( malt ) lymphomas are characterized by lymphoepithelial lesions pathologically . \n colonic malt lymphomas are relatively rarer than lymphomas of the stomach or small intestine . \n endoscopically , colonic malt lymphoma frequently appears as a nonpedunculated protruding polypoid mass and/or an ulceration in the cecum and/or rectum . \n we report a unique case of a colonic malt lymphoma presenting as a semipedunculated polyp . a 54-year - old man was found to have a 2-cm semipedunculated polyp in the sigmoid colon during screening colonoscopy . \n the polyp was removed by endoscopic mucosal resection . \n histologic examination of the resected polyp revealed diffuse epithelial infiltration by discrete aggregates of lymphoma cells . \n we diagnosed the tumor as low - grade b - cell malt lymphoma by immunohistochemical staining .

", " diclofenac , a nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug , induces apoptosis on the neuroblastoma cell line sh - sy5y through a mitochondrial dysfunction , affecting some antioxidant mechanisms . \n indeed , the time- and dose - dependent increase of apoptosis is associated to an early enhancement of the reactive oxygen species ( ros ) . \n mitochondrial superoxide dismutase ( sod2 ) plays a crucial role in the defence against ros , thus protecting against several apoptotic stimuli . \n diclofenac decreased the protein levels and the enzymatic activity of sod2 , without any significant impairment of the corresponding mrna levels in the sh - sy5y extracts . \n when cells were incubated with an archaeal exogenous thioredoxin , an attenuation of the diclofenac - induced apoptosis was observed , together with an increase of sod2 protein levels . \n furthermore , diclofenac impaired the mitochondrial membrane potential , leading to a release of cytochrome c. these data suggest that mitochondria are involved in the diclofenac - induced apoptosis of sh - sy5y cells and point to a possible role of sod2 in this process . ", " the contamination of seafood by bacteria of fecal origin , especially escherichia coli , is a widely documented sanitary problem . \n the objective of the present study was to isolate e. coli strains from the gills , muscle , and body surface of farmed nile tilapias ( oreochromis niloticus ) fresh - marketed in supermarkets in fortaleza ( cear , brazil ) , to determine their susceptibility to antibiotics of different families ( amikacin , gentamicin , imipenem , cephalothin , cefotaxime , ciprofloxacin , aztreonam , ampicillin , nalidixic acid , tetracycline , and sulfametoxazol - trimetoprim ) , and to determine the nature of resistance by plasmid curing . \n forty - four strains ( body surface = 25 , gills = 15 , muscle = 4 ) were isolated , all of which were susceptible to amikacin , aztreonam , cefotaxime , ciprofloxacin , gentamicin , and imipenem . \n gill and body surface samples yielded 11 isolates resistant to ampicillin , tetracycline , and sulfametoxazol - trimetoprim , 4 of which of plasmidial nature . \n the multiple antibiotic resistance index was higher for strains isolated from body surface than from gills . \n the overall high antibiotic susceptibility of e. coli strains isolated from fresh - marketed tilapia was satisfactory , although the occasional finding of plasmidial resistance points to the need for close microbiological surveillance of the farming , handling , and marketing conditions of aquaculture products .

", " purpose : of this study was to explore the effect of social support on the levels of anxiety and depression of hemodialysis patients.material and methods:258 patients undergoing hemodialysis were enrolled . a questionnaire developed for the purpose of the study \n was used to collect data through the interview process . apart from socio - demographic , clinical and other characteristics \n , the questionnaire also included the multidimensional scale of perceived social support ( mspss ) to assess social support from significant others , family and friends , and the questionnaire hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) to assess the levels of anxiety and depression of patients.results:53,9% of the participants were male while 34,1% of the participants were > 70 years old . 32,9% and 30,2% of the participants felt high levels of anxiety and depression , respectively . \n analysis of data showed a statistically significant association between anxiety / depression and social support from significant others , family and friends ( p=<0,001 for all associations ) . \n in particular , patients with high levels of anxiety and depression felt less support from their significant others , family and friends . \n the multinomial logistic regression , showed a statistically significant effect of social support from friends in anxiety levels ( p=0,004 ) . \n an one point increase of the support from friends seems to reduce by 57% the probability of having high levels of anxiety . in addition , statistically significant effect of social support from significant others , family and friends was observed on the levels of depression ( p=<0,001 , p=0,001 & p=0,003 , respectively ) . \n specifically , an one point increase of the support from significant others , family and friends it was found to reduce by 77% , 71% and 56% respectively the probability of experiencing high levels of depression.conclusions:phyco-social evaluation is essential when providing holistic care to hemodialysis patients . ", " esophageal achalasia is a motility disorder characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and dilatation of the distal two - thirds of the esophagus . \n this condition may be a non - frequent reason of extrinsic compression of left atrium . in turn \n , this can be a cause of some hemodynamic changes such as chest discomfort , dyspnea or reduced exercise tolerance , systemic hypotension and tachycardia . \n we describe a case of a patient with esophagus achalasia compressing the left atrium and inducing hemodynamic compromise . \n the diagnostic methods , as chest x - ray , computed tomography ( ct ) , manometry , and 2d - trans - thoracic echocardiography ( tte ) demonstrated the esophagus dilation , the impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter , and its compression on the left atrium . \n three - d trans - thoracic echocardiography ( 3d - tte ) was firstly performed also . \n this last examination pointed out better than 2d - tte the extrinsic compression of the left atrium due to the esophagus dilatation . \n therefore , 3d - tte is a true improvement for the echocardiographic diagnosis of the left atrial compression induced by esophageal achalasia . ", " due primarily to the increasing shortage of allogeneic donor organs , xenotransplantation has become the focus of a growing field of research . \n currently , micropigs are the most suitable donor animal for humans . however , no standard method has been developed to evaluate the systemic vascular anatomy of micropigs and standard reference values to aid in the selection of normal healthy animals as potential organ donors are lacking . using 64-channel multidetector row computed tomographic angiography ( mdcta ) , we evaluated morphological features of the major systemic vessels in micropigs and compared our results to published human data . \n the main vasculature of the animals was similar to that of humans , except for the iliac arterial system . \n however , diameters of the major systemic vessels were significantly different between micropigs and humans . \n specifically , the diameter of the aortic arch , abdominal aorta , external iliac artery , and femoral artery , were measured as 1.50  0.07 cm , 0.85  0.06 cm , 0.52  0.05 cm , and 0.48  0.05 cm , respectively , in the micropigs . \n this mdcta data for micropig major systemic vessels can be used as standard reference values for xenotransplantation studies . \n the use of 64-channel mdcta enables accurate evaluation of the major systemic vasculature in micropigs . ", " amide hydrogen / deuterium exchange ( h / d exchange ) coupled with mass spectrometry has been widely used to analyze the interface of protein - protein interactions , protein conformational changes , protein dynamics and protein - ligand interactions . \n h / d exchange on the backbone amide positions has been utilized to measure the deuteration rates of the micro - regions in a protein by mass spectrometry1,2,3 . \n the resolution of this method depends on pepsin digestion of the deuterated protein of interest into peptides that normally range from 3 - 20 residues . \n although the resolution of h / d exchange measured by mass spectrometry is lower than the single residue resolution measured by the heteronuclear single quantum coherence ( hsqc ) method of nmr , the mass spectrometry measurement in h / d exchange is not restricted by the size of the protein4 . \n h / d exchange is carried out in an aqueous solution which maintains protein conformation . we provide a method that utilizes the maldi - tof for detection2 , instead of a hplc / esi ( electrospray ionization)-ms system5,6 . \n the maldi - tof provides accurate mass intensity data for the peptides of the digested protein , in this case protein kinase pak2 ( also called -pak ) . \n proteolysis of pak 2 is carried out in an offline pepsin digestion . \n this alternative method , when the user does not have access to a hplc and pepsin column connected to mass spectrometry , or when the pepsin column on hplc does not result in an optimal digestion map , for example , the heavily disulfide - bonded secreted phospholipase a2 ( spla2 ) . \n utilizing this method , we successfully monitored changes in the deuteration level during activation of pak2 by caspase 3 cleavage and autophosphorylation7,8,9 . ", " according to a patient - centered viewpoint , the meaning of harmonization in the context of laboratory medicine is that the information should be comparable irrespective of the measurement procedure used and where and/or when a measurement is made . \n harmonization represents a fundamental aspect of quality in laboratory medicine as its ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through the provision of an accurate and actionable laboratory information . \n although the initial focus has to a large extent been to harmonize and standardize analytical processes and methods , the scope of harmonization goes beyond to include all other aspects of the total testing process ( ttp ) , such as terminology and units , report formats , reference intervals and decision limits , as well as tests and test profiles request and criteria for interpretation . \n two major progresses have been made in the area of harmonization in laboratory medicine : first , the awareness that harmonization should take into consideration not only the analytical phase but all steps of the ttp , thus dealing with the request , the sample , the measurement , and the report . \n second , as the processes required to achieve harmonization are complicated , a systematic approach is needed . \n the international federation of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine ( ifcc ) has played a fundamental and successful role in the development of standardized and harmonized assays , and now it should continue to work in the field through the collaboration and cooperation with many other stakeholders . ", " type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder that develops as a result of relatively inappropriate insulin secretion and insulin resistance . increased levels of free fatty acids ( ffas ) are one of the important factors for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and contribute to defective -cell proliferation and increased -cell apoptosis . \n recently , glucagon - like peptide-1 ( glp-1 ) receptor agonists have been shown to possess an antiapoptotic effect , by increasing -cell mass and improving -cell function . \n however , their effects on -cells in vitro against lipotoxicity have not been elucidated completely . in this study \n , we investigated whether the glp-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 displays prosurvival effects in pancreatic -cells exposed to chronic elevated ffas . \n results showed that exendin-4 inhibited apoptosis induced by palmitate in min6 cells . \n after 24  h of incubation , exendin-4 caused rapid activation of extracellular signal - related kinase 1/2 ( erk1/2 ) under lipotoxic conditions . \n the erk1/2 inhibitor pd98059 blocked the antilipotoxic effect of exendin-4 on min6 cells . \n exendin-4 also inhibited the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis . \n this inhibition is associated with upregulation of bcl-2 . \n our findings suggested that exendin-4 may exert cytoprotective effects through activation of erk1/2 and inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway . ", " ribonucleic acids ( rna ) are hypothesized to have preceded their derivatives , deoxyribonucleic acids ( dna ) , as the molecular media of genetic information when life emerged on earth . \n molecular biologists are accustomed to the dramatic effects a subtle variation in the ribose moiety composition between rna and dna can have on the stability of these molecules . while dna is very stable after extraction from biological samples and subsequent treatment , rna is notoriously labile . the short half - life property , inherent to rna , benefits cells that do not need to express their entire repertoire of proteins . \n the cellular machinery turns off the production of a given protein by shutting down the transcription of its cognate coding gene and by either actively degrading the remaining mrna or allowing it to decay on its own . \n the steady - state level of each mrna in a given cell varies continuously and is specified by changing kinetics of synthesis and degradation . because it is technically possible to simultaneously measure thousands of nucleic acid molecules , \n these quantities have been studied by the life sciences community to investigate a range of biological problems . \n since the rna abundance can change according to a wide range of perturbations , this makes it the molecule of choice for exploring biological systems ; its instability , on the other hand , could be an underestimated source of technical variability . we found that a large fraction of the rna abundance originally present in the biological system prior to extraction was masked by the rna labeling and measurement procedure . \n the method used to extract rna molecules from cells and to label them prior to hybridization operations on dna arrays affects the original distribution of rna . \n only if rna measurements are performed according to the same procedure can biological information be inferred from the assay read out .
