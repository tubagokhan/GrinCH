supported.30 in fact , anemia itself is a risk factor for infections in patients receiving hemodialysis.31 a multivariate analysis of associations between iron and mortality in more than 58,000 patients receiving hemodialysis reported no increased death rate from serum ferritin levels as high as 1,200 ng / ml.30 the increasing cost of therapy in patients with cancer is of grave concern , which could be an additional benefit of iv iron over the use of esas in such patients . the highest serum ferritin level in the present study in patients who completed at least 9 weeks of iv iron therapy was 1,170 ng / ml . although the role of esas is well - established in treating caa , big concerns were recently raised about the negative effect of esas on survival in some patients with cancer.911 concerns about the risk for thromboembolism in patients with cancer with higher hb levels who are receiving esa were also addressed in many trials.22,23 in addition , the possible immunosuppressive effects of blood product transfusions that may have relevance to neoplasia progression were addressed before.24 , 25 in our pilot study , we tested the feasibility of using iron supplementation alone to treat anemia in patients with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy without the use of esas or blood transfusion , which could be a valid alternative , especially for patients with curable cancers . eight ( 42.1% ) of the 19 patients who completed at least three iron infusions had a more than 1 g / dl increase in their hb level . patients were also required to have a serum ferritin level of 100 ng / ml or higher or transferrin saturation ( tsat ) levels of 15% or higher and to have received no esas or iv iron therapy within 30 days and no oral iron therapy ( 27 mg / day or more ) within 7 days before enrollment . patients were also required to have a serum ferritin level of 100 ng / ml or higher or transferrin saturation ( tsat ) levels of 15% or higher and to have received no esas or iv iron therapy within 30 days and no oral iron therapy ( 27 mg / day or more ) within 7 days before enrollment . patients received the study treatment for 12 weeks followed by a 4-week follow -

risk factor , and increases in range of postural sway in the mediolateral direction in older adults are associated with increased fall - risk and rates . if this threshold situation is true , it may be that seasonal variation in postural sway may be present in a population with much lower levels of vitamin d , but this is outside the scope of the current study .", "effect of alkaloids from senna alata leaves on some female reproductive hormones of pregnant wistar rats values are expressed as meansd of six independent determinations ; test values carrying superscripts different from the control for each parameter in the same row are significantly different ( p < 0.05 ) the alkaloids also decreased ( p < 0.05 ) the absolute weight of the uterus , computed uterine to body weight ratio , and concentrations of uterine glucose and cholesterol ( table 3 ) . overall , the alkaloid from s. alata leaves at the oral doses of 250 , 500 and 1000 mg / kg body weight on daily basis from days 10 until day 18 post -

associated mirnas such as mir-146a , mir-181 , and mir-21 are frequently detected at a high level in skeletal muscle ; however , their functions are still not fully clear . in turn\n, inflammation aggravates muscle loss and fat accumulation in the aging skeletal muscle and further decreases muscle function and physical activity . since a large number of mirnas\nhave been identified in skeletal muscle , the investigation of mirnas is a promising but relatively unexplored area for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of wasting process associated with cytokine expression and secretion in aging skeletal muscle . in order to elucidate which mirna is important in the production of proinflammatory cytokines in aging - related muscle wasting , mrna targets and specific roles in regeneration and protein synthesis in skeletal muscle need to be established . one of the mechanisms proposed for the induction of skeletal muscle wasting by tweak is regulating differential expression of several growth -

diabetic agents dpp-4 inhibitors could be a more safer option while managing type-2 diabetes during ramadan fasting , with a very low risk of hypoglycemia.47 another prospective , noninterventional study published in france to assess real life rate of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting in patients with type 2 diabetes and their ongoing dual therapy of metformin  vildagliptin or metformin  sulfonylurea has shown that hypoglycemia as an adverse events ( aes ) was higher in su group as compared to vildagliptin group ( 17.9% vs 7.5% ; p=0.025 ) , and better compliance was seen with vildagliptin group.48 the virtue ( vildagliptin experience compared with sulphonylureas observed during ramadan ) study , which recruited 1,333 patients from 10 different countries worldwide , has demonstrated significantly fewer hypoglycemia events as compared with su therapy ( 5.4% vs 19.8% , respectively ; p<0.001 ) . however , this risk was significantly reduced when vildagliptin was prescribed during ramadan fasting , and this has also been recently reported in indo - pakistani populations from the uk and in cohorts of uk south asian muslim patients in the vector ( vildagliptin experience compared to gliclazide observed during ramadan ) study.4042 furthermore , in general , these agents have also been demonstrated to be safer in older age group.43 a recent observational study which combined metformin and vildagliptin therapy together with or without ohas during ramadan fasting has demonstrated advantage of reduced hypoglycemia incidence.44 they have shown one case of severe hypoglycemia in the arm treated with oha compared to the vildagliptin group , which showed no hypoglycemia event . furthermore , survey results have shown that 53% of patients fasted against medical advice.57 however , this can be prevented effectively by extensive dsme and ramadan - focused diabetes management ; ramadan education and awareness in diabetes ( read ) program and similar studies have demonstrated promising and good results in terms of minimizing hypoglycemia risk during ramadan fasting.1,58,59 effective diabetes education for patients empowerment and motivation with self - care awareness involves health care professional teams , families , the community , and religious authorities as well.60,61 additionally , newer antidiabetic agents , such as vildagliptin ( dpp-4 inhibitor ) , that are associated with lower risk of hypoglycemia , are considered to be one of the safer options while managing diabetes during ramadan fasting , and have also shown higher treatment adherence as compared to other medications.62 other studies have reported similar results when comparing ohas with vildagliptin.45 another study conducted on vildagliptin and sus or ohas during ramadan fasting has reported higher incidence of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting in the group treated with su and metformin vs vildagliptin plus metformin ( 26 episodes vs 19 episodes ) ; and also reported hba1c reduction in the vildagliptin group , however , with insignificant p - values.46 a study conducted by aziz1 has also concluded that the patient group prescribed with dpp-4 inhibitors such as sitagliptin / vildagliptin did not show any episodes of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting . it has been well documented in medical literature that diabetes management during ramadan fasting poses challenges to the treating physician ; and pre - ramadan diabetes assessment , evaluations , and diabetes education are important for successful management.1 this is because unplanned diabetes management during ramadan fasting may lead to hypoglycemia . contrary to these facts , different studies conducted in the past during ramadan fasting have demonstrated high prevalence of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting ( up to 21.7%).1018 however , these studies were mostly observational in nature , and patients were not selected before ramadan for extensive diabetes self - management education ( dsme ) , counseling , assessment for hba1c / creatinine , and alteration of therapy . we will focus on the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes , dpp-4 inhibitors , and the role of vildagliptin during ramadan fasting . the epidemiology of diabetes and ramadan ( epidiar ) study has reported a 7.5-fold increase in risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes.2 however , this risk can be reduced by extensive diabetes education and pre - ramadan medication adjustments.1 hence , ramadan itself is not a risk , but poor education and use of medications which cause hypoglycemia with high dosages carries a risk .", "pseudoprogression ( pspd ) and pseudoresponse ( psr ) following anticancer therapy are major areas of controversy in the management of high -

upon value that discriminates between healthy and dry eyes is when the higher tear film osmolarity value of the two eyes is 308 mosm / l.5,10 as with any diagnostic tool , interpretation must be based on the complete clinical picture , including other diagnostic tests that might be helpful in determining the dry eye etiology.10 certain commonly encountered external factors such as contact lens wear may or may not increase tear osmolarity , depending on the individual response.2,24 the impact of environmental factors , such as temperature , humidity , and airflow on tear osmolarity appears unclear , as is the effect of sex hormones ; these factors would benefit from further investigation.20,21,25,36,37 the effect of ocular surgery on tear osmolarity may be partially dependent on the patient s age , the type of surgery performed , and the ability of the eye to recover.2629 systemic conditions commonly believed to result in dry eye , such as dehydration , diabetes , and thyroid ophthalmopathy , have been shown to increase tear osmolarity , as expected.31,32,35 ocular conditions , such as herpetic keratitis , pterygia , and pseudoexfoliation syndrome , have also been demonstrated to increase tear osmolarity.38,39,41 keratoconus , largely viewed clinically as a non - inflammatory condition , was not associated with increased tear osmolarity.40 some pharmaceuticals , such as mucin - altering drugs and glaucoma medications , appear to increase tear osmolarity , while others , such as artificial tears , likely lower tear osmolarity.20,28,43 research into the effect of anti - inflammatory medications on tear osmolarity has produced varied results ; the topic deserves further investigation.48,49,51 there are limitations in any review of this nature , and consequently to any of our comments related to the factors associated with osmolarity . this may be an important factor , because the type of eye drop can impact tear osmolarity.45 for instance , lower osmolarity eye drops have been associated with lower tear osmolarity.46,47 it has been noted that the decrease in osmolarity observed with the use of artificial tears may be comparable to the effects of heat and massage application to the eyelids using a thermal massager.44 the effect of anti - inflammatory medication on tear osmolarity is less clear , especially because the studies evaluating this effect suffer from limitations such as small sample size and the lack of a control group or randomization.4850 in one recent randomized , double - blind , parallel study in finland , osmolarity was observed to increase through the dry winter months.51 participants taking oral sea buckthorn oil , containing n-3 and n-6 fatty acids and antioxidants , had less of an increase in tear osmolarity when compared to a control group , presumed to have been a function of the oil s anti -

thyroidism presenting with dysarthria . dysarthria due to hypothyroidism had been reported only once previous to this case.3 the pathophysiology of dysarthria in hypothyroidism can be explained by edematous swelling of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal structures in combination with macroglossia.3 it has been shown that macroglossia in hypothyroidism is caused by a thickening of the epithelial tissue.6 these changes can also explain the choking and the dysphagia which this patient experienced . other causes such as congenital or aquired storage disorders such as amyloidosis , and such endocrine disorders as acromegaly or hypo - thyroidism,3 as in the presented case , may lead to an enlargement of one or more of the components of the vocal cords.56 the most likely cause for the dysarthria in this patient was hypothyroidism . two months after the initiation of therapy , the patient had no more dysarthria or other associated symptoms . there have been a few reports of hypothyroidism responsible for secondary dysphagia.1012 her sleep apnea may also be a manifestation of hypothyroidism , most likely caused by edema and myopathy.7 sleep apnea attributable to hypothyroidism is reversible with thyroxin replacement therapy.8 the episodic hoarseness of voice can also be explained by hypothyroidism,1 as well as the delayed recovery from anaethesia the year before , most probably the result of undiagnosed hypothyroidism.91314 unfortunately , thyroid function tests had not been performed on our patient at that time . dysarthria is a disturbance of articulation that may be caused by a neuromuscular lesion , or an abnormality of the vocal cords .", "the narrowness and shallowness of bg have been redefined objectively in relation to dimensions of both bicipital groove and biceps tendon for adequate prediction of pathologies of biceps tendon . as the biceps tendon\nis enshrined in bg , width may influence the pathology occurring in this tendon . though the precise definition of narrowness / shallowness of bg is difficult yet systematic , relative and constrained definition depending on the dimensions of bicep tendon and its natural abode , that is , bicipital groove ,\nis formulated as follows.if the width of bg is less than the width of biceps tendon , it is a narrow bg which may produce attritional changes causing impingement , inflammation , and degeneration . as per morphometric data ( table 3 ) of bg and biceps tendon as observed in two cadavers in the present study , the groove is not shallow according to new definition of shallowness . figure 3 shows the biceps tendon and bg in a dissected cadaver wherein the biceps tendon is positioned and perfectly well protected in bg . in the present study the data of bg and biceps tendon observed from two cadavers\ndo not indicate narrow bg as per new definition of narrowness and shallowness given in section 2 . in wider groove the tendon\n\n the morphometry of the bicipital groove in terms of length of media wall , lateral wall , length of bg , width , depth medial wall angle , and opening angle has been elucidated with reference to north indian population.the data on morphometry of bg will be of utmost use for anatomist , radiologists , orthopaedic surgeons , and physicians.the new definition of narrow / shallow bg has been given . the bg in this case is not shallow as seen in the above -

called  adipose tissue expandability hypothesis ,  where the pathological expansion of abdominal adipose tissue in morbid obesity reaches a threshold characterized by an inability of adipose tissue to expand because its capacity to recruit new adipocytes is exhausted . on the other hand , brca1 was found to be up - regulated in adipose tissue from obese subjects independently of whether they had t2d , so we suggest a crosstalk between brca1 , lipogenesis , adipogenesis , obesity , and obesity - associated ir . but lipogenesis is not the only process involved ; other crucial processes for the normal function of the adipose tissue are adipogenesis , apoptosis , and angiogenesis : necessary processes to help in the adipose tissue expansion in order to avoid future metabolic disturbances caused by the excess of fatty acids . we have suggested that the adipose tissue and the liver may act in a balanced manner depending on the ir status , as a decrease in fabp4 expression was observed in adipose tissue from metabolically obese patients versus metabolically healthy humans , while the opposite takes place in the liver , with an increase in fabp4 expression in metabolically obese patients , with the ir status being an important determinant in tissue expression . this is closely associated with the storage capacity in adipose and muscle tissues , with the mismatch between energy surplus and storage capacity in adipose tissue and muscle tissues possibly being an important factor linking obesity and ir . thus , the ability of adipose tissue to expand and match the storage needs of energy surplus may be a key determinant in protection against the metabolic syndrome associated with obesity . beyond expandability of adipose tissue ,\nadipose tissue is very dynamic ; as much as 10% of the fat cells die and are renewed every year .", "in conclusion , we report the first case of alp and ipso co -

encoded anti - crispr proteins to be described . could the phage onslaught result in a diversity of crispr - cas immunity sufficient to over - power escape phage development ? another study on the same species demonstrated that in addition to the expected competition between crispr - cas immunity and phage escape mutants , there were some unanticipated results : phages could establish themselves in a culture containing one ( but not 2 ) spacers targeting it , bacteria without crispr - cas immunity persist in cultures despite presence of a large amount of phage , and bacteria with 2 spacers targeting a phage could still not establish themselves in a population of phage - sensitive bacteria . indeed , a dms3vir phage encoding an anti - crispr protein affected high - diversity crispr populations in the same manner as crispr monocultures , demonstrating that the usefulness of crispr - cas immunity is basically nullified .", "two classes of agents , \n those targeting the m2 ion -

grade malt lymphoma . malt lymphoma , a subtype of non - hodgkin lymphoma , is classified as an extranodal marginal zone b - cell lymphoma and is a lymphoepithelial lesion characterized by epithelial infiltration by lymphoplasma cells.1,2 malt lymphoma of the stomach is known to be associated with helicobacter pylori infection,11 whereas nongastric malt lymphomas have been associated with borrelia burgdorferi , chlamydia psittaci , hepatitis c virus , campylobacter jejuni , and autoimmune disease.12 colonic malt lymphoma occurs at an average age of 59.8 years and shows no sex preference . plasma cell differentiation is observed in one - third of all malt lymphomas.17 however , it is difficult to differentiate malt lymphoma and follicular lymphoma in the presence of multiple lymphoid follicles.14 moreover , malt lymphoma is often confused with mantle cell lymphoma because of their histologic similarities . cases of primary colonic malt lymphoma reported in korea have presented as multiple submucosal tumors ( one case),4 a nonpedunculated protruding polypoid mass ( four cases),5,6,7,8 obstructive lesions of the colon caused by mucosal edema or a tumor ( two cases),9,10 or mucosal discoloration ( one case).11 here , we report the case of a colonic malt lymphoma presenting as a semipedunculated polyp that was removed by endoscopic mucosal resection ( emr ) . some have reported that antibiotic treatment against h. pylori is effective for colonic malt lymphoma , and that this treatment influences even h. pylori - negative patients,19 which suggests that some strains sensitive to antibiotics for h. pylori eradication contribute to malt lymphoma development in these patients . a malt lymphoma can be diagnosed during surgery or endoscopic biopsy . in the described case ,\nmalt lymphoma presented as a semipedunculated polyp during colonoscopy , and diagnosis and treatment planning were performed on the basis of the results of emr . however , in some rare cases , intestinal obstruction or intussusception can appear.9,10,13,14 systemic symptoms such as fever and weight loss are rare because most malt lymphomas are well localized and slow growing.12 according to endoscopic findings , a malt lymphoma of the colon usually appears as a sessile protruding lesion or ulcerative lesion , and the former is approximately 10 times more common than the latter.14,15 sites of tumor growth have been reported to be the cecum ( 71.5% ) , rectum ( 16.9% ) , and ascending colon ( 6.2% ) ; however , the sigmoid colon is only rarely affected.16 eight cases have been reported in korea , and these are summarized in table 1 .", "regarding the recipient site , resorption areas and new bone formation \n areas\ngroup ii  30 days : underneath , bone graft is linked to the recipient site \n only in the graft margin . at the \n peripheral regions ,\nnew bone formation , with \n primary bone tissue ( asterisks ) , from the graft fragment ( bone graft -

operative hypotension in dopamine secreting tumor patients . the exclusive production of dopamine can be ascribed to a deficiency in dopamine -hydroxylase which converts dopamine to norepinephrine in the catecholamine biosynthesis pathway beginning with tyrosine . this rare tumor tends to be diagnosed in patients who are asymptomatic , and the tumor is detected later than tumors that secrete norepinepnrine , epinephrine or both . our preoperative diagnosis was a dopamine producing paraganglioma in the right retroperitoneum . clinicians should not rule out the possibility of this rare tumor when evaluating adrenal masses with normal serum norepinephrine , epinephrine and urinary vma levels , even if the radiologic images strongly suggest a pheochromocytoma .", "hypereosinophilic syndrome is defined as an eosinophil count > 1,500/l that is sustained for > 6 months without any other clear cause.10 ) this patient had transient eosinophilia and recovered spontaneously , although the actual onset of eosinophilia was not identified\na pe may show non -

lengths of the cag repeat tracts that occur in polyq disease - related transcripts and the cug repeats in the transcript responsible for dm1 . a serious difficulty in identifying the involvement of rna toxicity in polyq diseases is the overlap with the polyq toxicity in models expressing cag repeats from the orf , and placing the repeat in the untranslated sequence of a heterologous gene is frequently used to overcome this difficulty and trace the effects of mutant rna . potentially toxic entities , an expanded cag repeat - containing transcript and a polyq - containing protein , are marked in red ; a transcript containing expanded caa repeats , presumed to be nontoxic , is marked in blue\nresearch on rna toxicity in polyq diseases is still in its infancy . the starting threshold for dm1 mutation ( 50 repeats ) is denoted by a hatched line the pathogenic number of cag repeats in genes implicated in polyq diseases is , in most cases , lower than the number of cug repeats in the dmpk gene of dm1 patients , and cag expansions typically span a much narrower range of repeat lengths ( fig . 2four types of models that can be used to separate rna toxicity and protein toxicity in

mg ) of acrylic resins and dentifrices , the resins qc-20 and lucitone 550 showed greater mass reduction , which indicated lower abrasion resistance as compared to the other resins . based on the obtained results and within the limitations of an in vitro study , it may be concluded that differences exist among heat - polymerized acrylic resins concerning abrasion resistance and that dentifrices specific for denture cleansing tend to cause less damage to acrylic resin surface . abrasion caused by brushing of acrylic resin denture bases polymerized by different methods may result in mass loss , surface roughness , loss of surface polishing , problems on denture adaptation due the loss of surface details and difficulty on the maintenance of denture hygiene7,21,22,27 . it is thus important to evaluate the abrasion resistance to brushing of heat - polymerized acrylic resins used for fabrication of denture bases . the acrylic resin hardness , the type of abrasive agent and its concentration , the dimension and form of abrasive particles , the toothbrush and the load applied are some of the different factors that influence the abrasion of acrylic resin by brushing4,7,12 . the acrylic resins and dentifrices used in this study are presented in tables 1 and 2 , respectively . due to the experimental conditions of this study\nsexson and phillips27 showed that mass reduction obtained from brushing rotating acrylic resin specimens was similar to that produced when specimens were allowed to remain stationary , although microscopic examination revealed that the rotating specimens had different surface topography . the aim of this study was to evaluate the mass loss of four commercially available heat - polymerized acrylic resins after simulated toothbrushing with three different dentifrices .", "we also analyzed the effect of nci8642 on the binding of dkk1 to lrp6 , to determine whether the compound could interfere with the interaction between dkk1 and lrp6 . when immobilized on the sensor chip , dkk1 lost the ability to bind lrp6 , suggesting that the immobilization caused a modification of dkk1 structure - function , thus the direct interaction of nci8642 to dkk1 was not measured . for the immunofluorescence detection of cell - bound dkk1 , lrp6 - 293 cells were seeded onto poly - d - lysine - coated coverslips 24 hours before the experiment and incubated with dkk1 or ap - dkk1 cm diluted in cell culture medium for 2 hours at 4c . our study confirmed that nci8642 acts as a dkk1 inhibitor , and we extended the finding to the interaction of dkk1 to lrp6 . interestingly , the compound was able to block dkk1 binding only when injected together with dkk1 , and not when injected sequentially after dkk1 , which is probably due to the high affinity of dkk1 for lrp6 compared with the micromolar affinity of nci8642 for lpr6 ( figures 2(c ) and 2(e ) ) . when dkk1 was injected together with nci8642 after 1-hour incubation at 25c\n, we observed a consistent reduction of dkk1 binding on lrp6 with 5  m and 10  m compound , and even a complete binding inhibition at the concentration of 20  m ( figures 2(d ) and 2(e)-upper panel ) . in fact , nci8642 blocked dkk1 binding on lrp6 , both in lrp6 overexpressing cells and in spr analysis . nci8642 was not able to displace dkk1 when injected after it and dkk1 could still bind to lrp6 when injected after nci8642 at the concentration of 20  m ( figure 2(e)-middle and lower panels ) .", "this indicates that , at least subjectively , the patients in ciat group perceived more

limited lesions.8 local resection for unifocal involvement and systemic chemotherapy for extensive multifocal lesions have been proposed as treatment modalities in lch,9 however spontaneous regression has been reported in some unifocal lch cases.1 herein , we report a case of unifocal lch presenting as an unusual limbal lesion which recurred after primary excision . there is only a single case report of limbal lch in which the patient remained asymptomatic for a while after complete excision of the primary lesion , but the tumor recurred 15 months afterwards.2,7 based on clinical and histopathological evaluations , the recurrent tumor partially responded to combination chemotherapy and the patient was clinically stable for 5.5 years.7 in our case , recurrence developed 10 months after resection of the primary lesion for which repeat resection together with corneoscleral patch grafting were performed and the patient has been tumor - free up to 4 months . unifocal involvement is the most common presentation of lch and the bone is the most frequently affected tissue.1 ocular involvement can be observed in 1% to 20% of lch cases.2 the condition may primarily involve the orbit , eyelid , epibulbar conjunctiva , cornea , iris , vitreous , choroid and optic nerve , or secondarily infiltrate ocular tissues from surrounding structures.3,4 intraocular involvement by lch has rarely been reported in letterer - siwe disease.5 the orbit is usually involved with unifocal lch , which has a distinct tendency for the superotemporal bone at the rim of the orbit.6 the limbus can rarely be involved in unifocal lch presenting clinically as an infiltrative solitary limbal nodule which may be misdiagnosed as amyloidosis , fibrous histiocytoma , lymphoma , and juvenile xanthogranuloma.2,7 the diagnosis of lch is based on characteristic histopathological features . during follow - up and after four months , no signs indicative of recurrence\nlch results from proliferation of langerhans cells normally present in the epidermis.10 the condition is characterized by a wide clinical spectrum varying from spontaneous regression to rapid progression , recurrence and long - lasting sequelae.11 lch encompasses three main clinical subtypes ; unifocal lch ( eosinophilic granuloma ) , multifocal lch ( hand - schuller - christian disease ) and systemic lch ( abt - letterer -

number of discharges and outpatient visits , respectively , and x is a vector of exogenous variables . because the ratio of outpatient to inpatient costs remained relatively steady , and the ratio of outpatient visits to discharges rose , it follows that the ratio of the average incremental cost of an outpatient visit to the average cost of a discharge fell . calculation of the incremental cost of

", " it is known that the brain adaptively recalibrates itself to small ( 100  ms ) auditory  visual ( av ) temporal asynchronies so as to maintain intersensory temporal coherence . \n here we explored whether spatial disparity between a sound and light affects av temporal recalibration . \n participants were exposed to a train of asynchronous av stimulus pairs ( sound - first or light - first ) with sounds and lights emanating from either the same or a different location . following a short exposure phase , \n participants were tested on an av temporal order judgement ( toj ) task . \n temporal recalibration manifested itself as a shift of subjective simultaneity in the direction of the adapted audiovisual lag . \n the shift was equally big when exposure and test stimuli were presented from the same or different locations . \n these results provide strong evidence for the idea that spatial co - localisation is not a necessary constraint for intersensory pairing to occur . ", " nucleosomes , a basic structural unit of eukaryotic chromatin , play a significant role in regulating gene expression . \n we have developed a web tool based on dna sequences known from empirical and theoretical studies to influence dna bending and flexibility , and to exclude nucleosomes . \n nxsensor ( available at ) finds nucleosome exclusion sequences , evaluates their length and spacing , and computes an  \n accessibility score giving the proportion of base pairs likely to be nucleosome - free . \n application of nxsensor to the promoter regions of housekeeping ( hk ) genes and those of tissue - specific ( ts ) genes revealed a significant difference between the two classes of gene , the former being significantly more open , on average , particularly near transcription start sites ( tsss ) . \n nxsensor should be a useful tool in assessing the likelihood of nucleosome formation in regions involved in gene regulation and other aspects of chromatin function . ", " mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( malt ) lymphomas are characterized by lymphoepithelial lesions pathologically . \n colonic malt lymphomas are relatively rarer than lymphomas of the stomach or small intestine . \n endoscopically , colonic malt lymphoma frequently appears as a nonpedunculated protruding polypoid mass and/or an ulceration in the cecum and/or rectum . \n we report a unique case of a colonic malt lymphoma presenting as a semipedunculated polyp . a 54-year - old man was found to have a 2-cm semipedunculated polyp in the sigmoid colon during screening colonoscopy . \n the polyp was removed by endoscopic mucosal resection . \n histologic examination of the resected polyp revealed diffuse epithelial infiltration by discrete aggregates of lymphoma cells . \n we diagnosed the tumor as low - grade b - cell malt lymphoma by immunohistochemical staining .

", " diclofenac , a nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug , induces apoptosis on the neuroblastoma cell line sh - sy5y through a mitochondrial dysfunction , affecting some antioxidant mechanisms . \n indeed , the time- and dose - dependent increase of apoptosis is associated to an early enhancement of the reactive oxygen species ( ros ) . \n mitochondrial superoxide dismutase ( sod2 ) plays a crucial role in the defence against ros , thus protecting against several apoptotic stimuli . \n diclofenac decreased the protein levels and the enzymatic activity of sod2 , without any significant impairment of the corresponding mrna levels in the sh - sy5y extracts . \n when cells were incubated with an archaeal exogenous thioredoxin , an attenuation of the diclofenac - induced apoptosis was observed , together with an increase of sod2 protein levels . \n furthermore , diclofenac impaired the mitochondrial membrane potential , leading to a release of cytochrome c. these data suggest that mitochondria are involved in the diclofenac - induced apoptosis of sh - sy5y cells and point to a possible role of sod2 in this process . ", " the contamination of seafood by bacteria of fecal origin , especially escherichia coli , is a widely documented sanitary problem . \n the objective of the present study was to isolate e. coli strains from the gills , muscle , and body surface of farmed nile tilapias ( oreochromis niloticus ) fresh - marketed in supermarkets in fortaleza ( cear , brazil ) , to determine their susceptibility to antibiotics of different families ( amikacin , gentamicin , imipenem , cephalothin , cefotaxime , ciprofloxacin , aztreonam , ampicillin , nalidixic acid , tetracycline , and sulfametoxazol - trimetoprim ) , and to determine the nature of resistance by plasmid curing . \n forty - four strains ( body surface = 25 , gills = 15 , muscle = 4 ) were isolated , all of which were susceptible to amikacin , aztreonam , cefotaxime , ciprofloxacin , gentamicin , and imipenem . \n gill and body surface samples yielded 11 isolates resistant to ampicillin , tetracycline , and sulfametoxazol - trimetoprim , 4 of which of plasmidial nature . \n the multiple antibiotic resistance index was higher for strains isolated from body surface than from gills . \n the overall high antibiotic susceptibility of e. coli strains isolated from fresh - marketed tilapia was satisfactory , although the occasional finding of plasmidial resistance points to the need for close microbiological surveillance of the farming , handling , and marketing conditions of aquaculture products .

", " purpose : of this study was to explore the effect of social support on the levels of anxiety and depression of hemodialysis patients.material and methods:258 patients undergoing hemodialysis were enrolled . a questionnaire developed for the purpose of the study \n was used to collect data through the interview process . apart from socio - demographic , clinical and other characteristics \n , the questionnaire also included the multidimensional scale of perceived social support ( mspss ) to assess social support from significant others , family and friends , and the questionnaire hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) to assess the levels of anxiety and depression of patients.results:53,9% of the participants were male while 34,1% of the participants were > 70 years old . 32,9% and 30,2% of the participants felt high levels of anxiety and depression , respectively . \n analysis of data showed a statistically significant association between anxiety / depression and social support from significant others , family and friends ( p=<0,001 for all associations ) . \n in particular , patients with high levels of anxiety and depression felt less support from their significant others , family and friends . \n the multinomial logistic regression , showed a statistically significant effect of social support from friends in anxiety levels ( p=0,004 ) . \n an one point increase of the support from friends seems to reduce by 57% the probability of having high levels of anxiety . in addition , statistically significant effect of social support from significant others , family and friends was observed on the levels of depression ( p=<0,001 , p=0,001 & p=0,003 , respectively ) . \n specifically , an one point increase of the support from significant others , family and friends it was found to reduce by 77% , 71% and 56% respectively the probability of experiencing high levels of depression.conclusions:phyco-social evaluation is essential when providing holistic care to hemodialysis patients . ", " esophageal achalasia is a motility disorder characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and dilatation of the distal two - thirds of the esophagus . \n this condition may be a non - frequent reason of extrinsic compression of left atrium . in turn \n , this can be a cause of some hemodynamic changes such as chest discomfort , dyspnea or reduced exercise tolerance , systemic hypotension and tachycardia . \n we describe a case of a patient with esophagus achalasia compressing the left atrium and inducing hemodynamic compromise . \n the diagnostic methods , as chest x - ray , computed tomography ( ct ) , manometry , and 2d - trans - thoracic echocardiography ( tte ) demonstrated the esophagus dilation , the impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter , and its compression on the left atrium . \n three - d trans - thoracic echocardiography ( 3d - tte ) was firstly performed also . \n this last examination pointed out better than 2d - tte the extrinsic compression of the left atrium due to the esophagus dilatation . \n therefore , 3d - tte is a true improvement for the echocardiographic diagnosis of the left atrial compression induced by esophageal achalasia . ", " due primarily to the increasing shortage of allogeneic donor organs , xenotransplantation has become the focus of a growing field of research . \n currently , micropigs are the most suitable donor animal for humans . however , no standard method has been developed to evaluate the systemic vascular anatomy of micropigs and standard reference values to aid in the selection of normal healthy animals as potential organ donors are lacking . using 64-channel multidetector row computed tomographic angiography ( mdcta ) , we evaluated morphological features of the major systemic vessels in micropigs and compared our results to published human data . \n the main vasculature of the animals was similar to that of humans , except for the iliac arterial system . \n however , diameters of the major systemic vessels were significantly different between micropigs and humans . \n specifically , the diameter of the aortic arch , abdominal aorta , external iliac artery , and femoral artery , were measured as 1.50  0.07 cm , 0.85  0.06 cm , 0.52  0.05 cm , and 0.48  0.05 cm , respectively , in the micropigs . \n this mdcta data for micropig major systemic vessels can be used as standard reference values for xenotransplantation studies . \n the use of 64-channel mdcta enables accurate evaluation of the major systemic vasculature in micropigs . ", " amide hydrogen / deuterium exchange ( h / d exchange ) coupled with mass spectrometry has been widely used to analyze the interface of protein - protein interactions , protein conformational changes , protein dynamics and protein - ligand interactions . \n h / d exchange on the backbone amide positions has been utilized to measure the deuteration rates of the micro - regions in a protein by mass spectrometry1,2,3 . \n the resolution of this method depends on pepsin digestion of the deuterated protein of interest into peptides that normally range from 3 - 20 residues . \n although the resolution of h / d exchange measured by mass spectrometry is lower than the single residue resolution measured by the heteronuclear single quantum coherence ( hsqc ) method of nmr , the mass spectrometry measurement in h / d exchange is not restricted by the size of the protein4 . \n h / d exchange is carried out in an aqueous solution which maintains protein conformation . we provide a method that utilizes the maldi - tof for detection2 , instead of a hplc / esi ( electrospray ionization)-ms system5,6 . \n the maldi - tof provides accurate mass intensity data for the peptides of the digested protein , in this case protein kinase pak2 ( also called -pak ) . \n proteolysis of pak 2 is carried out in an offline pepsin digestion . \n this alternative method , when the user does not have access to a hplc and pepsin column connected to mass spectrometry , or when the pepsin column on hplc does not result in an optimal digestion map , for example , the heavily disulfide - bonded secreted phospholipase a2 ( spla2 ) . \n utilizing this method , we successfully monitored changes in the deuteration level during activation of pak2 by caspase 3 cleavage and autophosphorylation7,8,9 . ", " according to a patient - centered viewpoint , the meaning of harmonization in the context of laboratory medicine is that the information should be comparable irrespective of the measurement procedure used and where and/or when a measurement is made . \n harmonization represents a fundamental aspect of quality in laboratory medicine as its ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through the provision of an accurate and actionable laboratory information . \n although the initial focus has to a large extent been to harmonize and standardize analytical processes and methods , the scope of harmonization goes beyond to include all other aspects of the total testing process ( ttp ) , such as terminology and units , report formats , reference intervals and decision limits , as well as tests and test profiles request and criteria for interpretation . \n two major progresses have been made in the area of harmonization in laboratory medicine : first , the awareness that harmonization should take into consideration not only the analytical phase but all steps of the ttp , thus dealing with the request , the sample , the measurement , and the report . \n second , as the processes required to achieve harmonization are complicated , a systematic approach is needed . \n the international federation of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine ( ifcc ) has played a fundamental and successful role in the development of standardized and harmonized assays , and now it should continue to work in the field through the collaboration and cooperation with many other stakeholders . ", " type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder that develops as a result of relatively inappropriate insulin secretion and insulin resistance . increased levels of free fatty acids ( ffas ) are one of the important factors for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and contribute to defective -cell proliferation and increased -cell apoptosis . \n recently , glucagon - like peptide-1 ( glp-1 ) receptor agonists have been shown to possess an antiapoptotic effect , by increasing -cell mass and improving -cell function . \n however , their effects on -cells in vitro against lipotoxicity have not been elucidated completely . in this study \n , we investigated whether the glp-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 displays prosurvival effects in pancreatic -cells exposed to chronic elevated ffas . \n results showed that exendin-4 inhibited apoptosis induced by palmitate in min6 cells . \n after 24  h of incubation , exendin-4 caused rapid activation of extracellular signal - related kinase 1/2 ( erk1/2 ) under lipotoxic conditions . \n the erk1/2 inhibitor pd98059 blocked the antilipotoxic effect of exendin-4 on min6 cells . \n exendin-4 also inhibited the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis . \n this inhibition is associated with upregulation of bcl-2 . \n our findings suggested that exendin-4 may exert cytoprotective effects through activation of erk1/2 and inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway . ", " ribonucleic acids ( rna ) are hypothesized to have preceded their derivatives , deoxyribonucleic acids ( dna ) , as the molecular media of genetic information when life emerged on earth . \n molecular biologists are accustomed to the dramatic effects a subtle variation in the ribose moiety composition between rna and dna can have on the stability of these molecules . while dna is very stable after extraction from biological samples and subsequent treatment , rna is notoriously labile . the short half - life property , inherent to rna , benefits cells that do not need to express their entire repertoire of proteins . \n the cellular machinery turns off the production of a given protein by shutting down the transcription of its cognate coding gene and by either actively degrading the remaining mrna or allowing it to decay on its own . \n the steady - state level of each mrna in a given cell varies continuously and is specified by changing kinetics of synthesis and degradation . because it is technically possible to simultaneously measure thousands of nucleic acid molecules , \n these quantities have been studied by the life sciences community to investigate a range of biological problems . \n since the rna abundance can change according to a wide range of perturbations , this makes it the molecule of choice for exploring biological systems ; its instability , on the other hand , could be an underestimated source of technical variability . we found that a large fraction of the rna abundance originally present in the biological system prior to extraction was masked by the rna labeling and measurement procedure . \n the method used to extract rna molecules from cells and to label them prior to hybridization operations on dna arrays affects the original distribution of rna . \n only if rna measurements are performed according to the same procedure can biological information be inferred from the assay read out .
