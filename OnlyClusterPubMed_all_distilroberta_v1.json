comprising cellular and humoral pathways are conserved throughout the animal kingdom and are controlled by signaling pathways activated by various stimuli 17 18 including pathogen recognition by immune surveillance systems . these organisms have been particularly useful for investigating hemolymph proteins and hemocyte function because of their relatively large larval size and hemolymph volume . also their immune signaling pathways are gradually being revealed by genomic and transcriptomic data 3238 . amps are small cationic peptides that insert into and disrupt microbial membranes thereby killing and clearing pathogens . amps are a conserved component of immunity in plants and animals and while they have diverse structures most can be assigned to larger families such as cecropins attacins defensins and diptericins . after amps are translated in the cytoplasm they are released into the hemolymph where their high concentrations and broad activity are thought to enhance

nucleosomes the basic structural units of chromatin are now thought to also be involved in this process 12 see also 34 . the dissociation or displacement of nucleosomes from dna by the action of other protein factors such as dna and histone modifying enzymes methylases kinases acetylases and deacetylases likely gives the basal transcription apparatus access to the promoter regions of genes 57 . a means for assessing the distribution of nucleosomes along stretches of regulatory dna would therefore be a useful addition to our understanding of gene regulation . in eukaryotic cells nucleosomes are formed by the binding of dna to histones 8 . we have developed a program nxsensor available at that locates nxss in dna and defines regions where nucleosomes are unlikely to be formed because of the presence of such sequences and their spacing at distances less than the number of base pairs in the nucleosome . we have applied nxsensor to sets of promoter sequences whose genes are known to differ

special attention should be deserved to the national minimum retesting interval project promoted by the clinical practice section of the association for clinical biochemistry acb in the uk uses a state of the art approach to set consensus evidence based recommendations on when a test should be repeated . further work to optimize sample transportation procedures as well as the identification of indicators for their monitoring has been done and this is a premise for future harmonization initiatives in this field 15 17 . while standardization which allows the establishment of metrological traceability to the system of units si represents the recommended approach for a multitude of measurands the si does not yet apply in particular when the components in the measurand comprise a heterogeneous mixture . current evidence collected in the uk and in australia demonstrates a significant variation in the units used for some tests and even more widespread variation in the way they are represented on screens and paper as well as the way they appear in electronic messages 33 . various practices a number of different terminologies and extremely different values have been described in the literature affecting the quality of critical results management . the identification and establishment of valuable quality indicators qis represents a promising strategy for collecting data on quality in the total testing process ttp and particularly for detecting any mistakes made in the individual steps of the ttp thus providing useful information for quality improvement projects 53 . in addition qis represent a fundamental requirement for the accreditation of clinical laboratories according to the international standard iso 1518954 .", "however until now whether exendin4 a glp1 receptor agonist exerts cytoprotective effects in pancreatic cells under lipotoxic condition had not been determined completely . therefore the aim of the present study was to investigate the potential antiapoptotic and prosurvival actions of exendin4 in pancreatic cells under a chronic lipotoxic condition and the underlying signaling pathways involved . fatty acid free bovine serum albumin bsa fraction v palmitate hoechst33258 345dimethylthiazol2yl25diphenyltetrazolium bromides mtt and pd98059 were purchased from sigma aldrich st . they were maintained in dulbecco modified eagle medium dmem containing 25 mm glucose 15 fetal bovine serum fbs 100 u ml penicillin 100 mg ml streptomycin 100 mg ml l glutamine and 5 g l mercaptoethanol in a 37c humidified atmosphere with 5 co2 and 95 air . min6 cells were cultured in a high glucose 25 mm serum free dmem with 0.5 bsa or 0.4 mm palmitate added 0.5 bsa with or without erk12 inhibitor in the presence or absence of exendin4 . graded doses of exendin4 1 10 100 and 500 nm were prepared freshly before tests . we investigated the effect of exendin4 on erk12 phosphorylation under palmitate treatment by detecting the ratio of phosphorylated erk12 expression to total erk12 expression figure 2a . the erk12 phosphorylation was blocked by palmitate exposure 0.624 0.048 versus 0.496 0.062 p 0.05 bsa versus pa ex at 0 min . all these results strongly suggested that exendin4 protected min6 cells against lipotoxicity at least in part via activation of erk12 signaling pathway . the mechanisms underlying apoptosis are regulated by defined biochemical pathways involving members of the bcl2 family .", "activities in cells are partially specified by their respective ribonucleic acid rna content.1 with respect to mrna at any given time a theoretical human cell would feature the whole or some subset of all of the protein coding gene s transcripts including all splice variants . note this estimate does not take into account rna editing and other post transcriptional rna modifying events that can potentially increase the number of elements in the theoretical human set of messenger rna mrna molecules.3 due to their biochemical properties mrnas can be dosed simultaneously in multiplexed assays . these array based methods make use of the fact that single strands of nucleic acids will form a duplex with a reverse complementary strand.4 multiplexing is enabled by designing a series of probes ie reverse complementary strands specific to their cognate mrna molecule within the range of hybridization parameter values . newly introduced rna quantification technologies collectively referred to as rna seq are skipping the hybridization step . one of these sources is the choice of microarray used for the measurement with each brand or source featuring its own set of probes . in its most widely used form the molecular identifier is a gene identifier with a 1to1 relationship between a gene and a transcript being implicit in this kind of representation . these physiological responses were also known to be specified by the activity of the liver . the obvious consequence is that the changes registered at the end of the assay can be attributed as much to the experimental procedure the confounding factor than to the biological perturbations . in other words there was no variability brought in to each laboratory set with regards to these data operations . the rna degradation plot for instance testifies of the extent to which the rna molecules were starting to be hydrolyzed .", "it can

progressive neurodegenerative disorder which is associated with selective loss of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta region of the midbrain . pd is broadly classified into a familial form resulting from genetic alterations like mutations or multiplication in the snca gene encoding alpha synuclein syn early onset form and the idiopathic form with unknown etiology late onset form . increasing evidence suggest that oxidative stress is a key contributor to the pathogenesis of pd which causes damage to nucleic acids both dna and rna proteins lipids and other cellular macromolecules whose functions are indispensable for cell survival . 8oxodg being a nonbulky dna lesion has high mutagenic potential by misincorporation of an adenine instead of cytosine causing g ct a transversion mutation . 8oxodg has also been implicated in an event called transcriptional mutagenesis tm whereby a misincorporated adenine in the transcribing mrna leads to the generation of mutated species of protein figure 1 . as shown in syn a53 t mutant species that was reported in the familial form of pd the pathologically misfolded proteins drive the template directed misfolding of the native monomeric proteins which contributes to the nucleation dependent fibrillation process . but the greatest paradox remains in the fact that production of reactive oxygen species ros as a by product of oxygen metabolism is highly toxic to cells . it can include both free radicals like superoxide hydroxyl radical and nitric oxide containing highly reactive unpaired electrons and molecules like hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite . oxidative stress originates when the rate of ros production is significantly higher compared with its elimination from the system . sequence of syn can be divided into three regions with distinct characteristics figure 2 1 the amphipathic lysine rich n terminus residues 160 which is mainly involved in membrane interactions 2 the middle hydrophobic

the cag repeats are translated into polyglutamine tracts in protein products and the entire group of resulting disorders is known as the polyglutamine polyq diseases . the expanded repeats are thought to exert their pathogenic effects at the protein level mainly through a gain of toxic function by the mutant protein . the structural features of the cag repeats are similar to the cug repeats forming hairpin structures in transcripts when the repeat tracts are long enough 1016 . finally we focus on the experimental models used to demonstrate rna toxicity in polyq diseases . the protein products of genes that undergo mutations leading to polyq diseases differ in their cellular functions and cover a wide range of molecular weights . terms such as toxic rna and rna toxicity are used to reflect the fact that the disease causing mutation is passed from the gene to the transcript only while the protein structure is unaffected by the mutation . the hallmarks of cells expressing expanded cug repeats are nuclear rna foci which are toxic to cells because they sequester important cellular proteins reducing their normal functional levels reviewed in 46 47 . the recent study by chan and colleagues revealed that cag repeat expansion induces nucleolar stress in polyglutamine diseases demonstrating that the expanded cag repeat rna interacts directly with nucleolin and that this interaction triggers a number of aberrant downstream cellular processes eventually leading to cell apoptosis . note that some constructs contained either pure cag or caa repeats and some contained other caa

characterized by chronic obstruction of expiratory flow affecting peripheral airways and is often associated with chronic bronchitis and emphysema thereby accelerating the decline in lung function.23 previous studies have found that nutritional status is the prognostic factor that is associated with the mortality in copd.46 weight loss is the major characteristic of malnutrition in copd.7 in 2002 nutritional risk was defined by the european society for parenteral and enteral nutrition espen.8 recently nutritional risk was found to be associated with the exacerbation of copd in the patients who were hospitalized because of copd.9 meanwhile it has been reported that nutritional risk is related to the development of copd in male smokers.10 in addition the exercise capacity is also another factor related to mortality in copd.11 limitation of the exercise capacity seriously affects the quality of life in copd patients.12 therefore many studies have aimed at strategies for improving the exercise capacity of copd patients.1314 however this effective and feasible strategy still needs further exploration . patients provided written informed consent before inclusion . before nutritional

considerable interindividual variability and antidrug antibodies adabs have been identified as one of the major factors impacting their clearance . thus serum trough levels and adab measurement have been proposed for the monitoring of anti tnf drugs and algorithms were defined for the management of patients with ibd . accordingly most of the efficient biologic therapies developed so far in ibd aimed at neutralizing the proinflammatory activity of the tnf pathway . consequently 20 to 30 percent of patients require dose intensification or interval adjustment in order to maintain long term

ifx trough levels after induction treatment or during maintenance therapy as predictors of sustained clinical response and showed a significant correlation between low ifx trough levels and decreased clinical response in cd and uc adult patients 3 4 34 4547 and in children with uc . these discrepancies could be explained by different methods of measurements for atis and ifx concentrations by the

disease typically results in chronic conjunctivitis and causes conjunctival and corneal scarring which can result in limbal stem cell deficiency and blindness.2 adequate control of ocular inflammation usually requires systemic as well as topical immunosuppressants . commonly used systemic medications include prednisone methotrexate mycophenolate mofetil mmf and cyclophosphamide.3 the porphyrias are metabolic disorders caused by defective enzymes within the heme synthetic pathway.4 these defective enzymes cause an accumulation of intermediates from the heme synthetic pathway that results in various clinical manifestations.45 porphyria cutanea tarda is the most common of the porphyrias and results from a deficiency in uroporphyrin decarboxylase which is the fifth enzyme in the heme synthetic pathway.6 this deficiency results in the accumulation of porphyrins in the liver and plasma . on exposure to light with a wavelength near 400 nm the porphyrins enter an excited state that can lead to the damage of proteins lipids and basement membranes.6 this process results in blisters fibrosis and scarring of the skin in areas of the body exposed to sunlight.6 park et al7 have reported a case of a 31year old with cicatricial conjunctivitis who was biopsy negative for ocp and was later diagnosed with porphyria cutanea tarda in this case the patient s clinical symptoms

and systemic disease have been reported to predispose patients to corneal infections . management of microbial keratitis commonly involves obtaining corneal scrapings for microbiological studies and then empiric broad spectrum treatment is typically initiated before culture results are available . for example trauma is a common risk factor for fungal keratitis in developing agricultural countries whereas contact lens wear is the main risk factor for bacterial keratitis in developed countries . we included patients with negative culture results if they presented with an epithelial defect and stromal infiltrate and responded favorably to antimicrobial treatment . we defined an ulcer as being central if it encroached within 2 mm of fixation peripheral if it involved a zone within 2 mm from the limbus and paracentral if it was between the central and peripheral zone . before the result of corneal ulcer culture could be obtained levofloxacin 0.5 alone or a combination of 2 fortified

developed stock breeding especially pig breeding as denmark sweden bulgaria etc . in addition some information is given how to make an evaluation of human exposure to ota on the base of the found concentrations of ota in human serum via calculating the daily ota intake of humans in endemic areas . the first and the most toxic compound discovered is ota which was isolated from aspergillus ochraceus and chemiclly defined in 1965 by several south african scientists 811 . however the analysis for ota of various feed samples from farms with high frequency of spontaneous mycotoxic porcine

circumstance in addition to low feed food levels of ota in bulgarian mpn and ben suggest a possible interaction between ota and other mycotoxins which needs to be proved figure 3 . on the other hand the low contamination levels of ota in pigs chicks feeds suggest a possible synergism between ota and other compounds produced by the same ochratoxinogenic fungi . the concentration of ota in feeding forages is probably more important than that of pa because the higher contamination levels of pa 60000 ppb pa in combine with 1000 ppb ota have not been able to produce more significant toxic effects . according to other authors a similar but less pronounced synergistic toxic effect has been observed at higher contamination levels of ota 1000 ppb . cholestyramine in contrast to the nonspecific

using standard procedures because of a distal location and instability of the microcatheter the guiding catheter was placed more distal into the internal carotid artery . early rebleeding was defined as expanding hemorrhage with worsening of the patient s condition within 30 days after coiling and diagnostic confirmation was made by ct when it showed an increased amount of hemorrhage compared with

infrequently encountered . various strategies to overcome venous occlusion exist including contralateral lead or device implantation venoplasty and surgical epicardial lead implantation . in cases of device upgrade any non functional leads were removed if there was no non functional lead for example upgrade from dual chamber pacing to crt p then the atrial lead was extracted with an attempt to

", " purpose : of this study was to explore the effect of social support on the levels of anxiety and depression of hemodialysis patients.material and methods:258 patients undergoing hemodialysis were enrolled . a questionnaire developed for the purpose of the study \n was used to collect data through the interview process . apart from socio - demographic , clinical and other characteristics \n , the questionnaire also included the multidimensional scale of perceived social support ( mspss ) to assess social support from significant others , family and friends , and the questionnaire hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) to assess the levels of anxiety and depression of patients.results:53,9% of the participants were male while 34,1% of the participants were > 70 years old . 32,9% and 30,2% of the participants felt high levels of anxiety and depression , respectively . \n analysis of data showed a statistically significant association between anxiety / depression and social support from significant others , family and friends ( p=<0,001 for all associations ) . \n in particular , patients with high levels of anxiety and depression felt less support from their significant others , family and friends . \n the multinomial logistic regression , showed a statistically significant effect of social support from friends in anxiety levels ( p=0,004 ) . \n an one point increase of the support from friends seems to reduce by 57% the probability of having high levels of anxiety . in addition , statistically significant effect of social support from significant others , family and friends was observed on the levels of depression ( p=<0,001 , p=0,001 & p=0,003 , respectively ) . \n specifically , an one point increase of the support from significant others , family and friends it was found to reduce by 77% , 71% and 56% respectively the probability of experiencing high levels of depression.conclusions:phyco-social evaluation is essential when providing holistic care to hemodialysis patients . ", " esophageal achalasia is a motility disorder characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and dilatation of the distal two - thirds of the esophagus . \n this condition may be a non - frequent reason of extrinsic compression of left atrium . in turn \n , this can be a cause of some hemodynamic changes such as chest discomfort , dyspnea or reduced exercise tolerance , systemic hypotension and tachycardia . \n we describe a case of a patient with esophagus achalasia compressing the left atrium and inducing hemodynamic compromise . \n the diagnostic methods , as chest x - ray , computed tomography ( ct ) , manometry , and 2d - trans - thoracic echocardiography ( tte ) demonstrated the esophagus dilation , the impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter , and its compression on the left atrium . \n three - d trans - thoracic echocardiography ( 3d - tte ) was firstly performed also . \n this last examination pointed out better than 2d - tte the extrinsic compression of the left atrium due to the esophagus dilatation . \n therefore , 3d - tte is a true improvement for the echocardiographic diagnosis of the left atrial compression induced by esophageal achalasia . ", " due primarily to the increasing shortage of allogeneic donor organs , xenotransplantation has become the focus of a growing field of research . \n currently , micropigs are the most suitable donor animal for humans . however , no standard method has been developed to evaluate the systemic vascular anatomy of micropigs and standard reference values to aid in the selection of normal healthy animals as potential organ donors are lacking . using 64-channel multidetector row computed tomographic angiography ( mdcta ) , we evaluated morphological features of the major systemic vessels in micropigs and compared our results to published human data . \n the main vasculature of the animals was similar to that of humans , except for the iliac arterial system . \n however , diameters of the major systemic vessels were significantly different between micropigs and humans . \n specifically , the diameter of the aortic arch , abdominal aorta , external iliac artery , and femoral artery , were measured as 1.50  0.07 cm , 0.85  0.06 cm , 0.52  0.05 cm , and 0.48  0.05 cm , respectively , in the micropigs . \n this mdcta data for micropig major systemic vessels can be used as standard reference values for xenotransplantation studies . \n the use of 64-channel mdcta enables accurate evaluation of the major systemic vasculature in micropigs . ", " amide hydrogen / deuterium exchange ( h / d exchange ) coupled with mass spectrometry has been widely used to analyze the interface of protein - protein interactions , protein conformational changes , protein dynamics and protein - ligand interactions . \n h / d exchange on the backbone amide positions has been utilized to measure the deuteration rates of the micro - regions in a protein by mass spectrometry1,2,3 . \n the resolution of this method depends on pepsin digestion of the deuterated protein of interest into peptides that normally range from 3 - 20 residues . \n although the resolution of h / d exchange measured by mass spectrometry is lower than the single residue resolution measured by the heteronuclear single quantum coherence ( hsqc ) method of nmr , the mass spectrometry measurement in h / d exchange is not restricted by the size of the protein4 . \n h / d exchange is carried out in an aqueous solution which maintains protein conformation . we provide a method that utilizes the maldi - tof for detection2 , instead of a hplc / esi ( electrospray ionization)-ms system5,6 . \n the maldi - tof provides accurate mass intensity data for the peptides of the digested protein , in this case protein kinase pak2 ( also called -pak ) . \n proteolysis of pak 2 is carried out in an offline pepsin digestion . \n this alternative method , when the user does not have access to a hplc and pepsin column connected to mass spectrometry , or when the pepsin column on hplc does not result in an optimal digestion map , for example , the heavily disulfide - bonded secreted phospholipase a2 ( spla2 ) . \n utilizing this method , we successfully monitored changes in the deuteration level during activation of pak2 by caspase 3 cleavage and autophosphorylation7,8,9 . ", " according to a patient - centered viewpoint , the meaning of harmonization in the context of laboratory medicine is that the information should be comparable irrespective of the measurement procedure used and where and/or when a measurement is made . \n harmonization represents a fundamental aspect of quality in laboratory medicine as its ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through the provision of an accurate and actionable laboratory information . \n although the initial focus has to a large extent been to harmonize and standardize analytical processes and methods , the scope of harmonization goes beyond to include all other aspects of the total testing process ( ttp ) , such as terminology and units , report formats , reference intervals and decision limits , as well as tests and test profiles request and criteria for interpretation . \n two major progresses have been made in the area of harmonization in laboratory medicine : first , the awareness that harmonization should take into consideration not only the analytical phase but all steps of the ttp , thus dealing with the request , the sample , the measurement , and the report . \n second , as the processes required to achieve harmonization are complicated , a systematic approach is needed . \n the international federation of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine ( ifcc ) has played a fundamental and successful role in the development of standardized and harmonized assays , and now it should continue to work in the field through the collaboration and cooperation with many other stakeholders . ", " type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder that develops as a result of relatively inappropriate insulin secretion and insulin resistance . increased levels of free fatty acids ( ffas ) are one of the important factors for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and contribute to defective -cell proliferation and increased -cell apoptosis . \n recently , glucagon - like peptide-1 ( glp-1 ) receptor agonists have been shown to possess an antiapoptotic effect , by increasing -cell mass and improving -cell function . \n however , their effects on -cells in vitro against lipotoxicity have not been elucidated completely . in this study \n , we investigated whether the glp-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 displays prosurvival effects in pancreatic -cells exposed to chronic elevated ffas . \n results showed that exendin-4 inhibited apoptosis induced by palmitate in min6 cells . \n after 24  h of incubation , exendin-4 caused rapid activation of extracellular signal - related kinase 1/2 ( erk1/2 ) under lipotoxic conditions . \n the erk1/2 inhibitor pd98059 blocked the antilipotoxic effect of exendin-4 on min6 cells . \n exendin-4 also inhibited the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis . \n this inhibition is associated with upregulation of bcl-2 . \n our findings suggested that exendin-4 may exert cytoprotective effects through activation of erk1/2 and inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway . ", " ribonucleic acids ( rna ) are hypothesized to have preceded their derivatives , deoxyribonucleic acids ( dna ) , as the molecular media of genetic information when life emerged on earth . \n molecular biologists are accustomed to the dramatic effects a subtle variation in the ribose moiety composition between rna and dna can have on the stability of these molecules . while dna is very stable after extraction from biological samples and subsequent treatment , rna is notoriously labile . the short half - life property , inherent to rna , benefits cells that do not need to express their entire repertoire of proteins . \n the cellular machinery turns off the production of a given protein by shutting down the transcription of its cognate coding gene and by either actively degrading the remaining mrna or allowing it to decay on its own . \n the steady - state level of each mrna in a given cell varies continuously and is specified by changing kinetics of synthesis and degradation . because it is technically possible to simultaneously measure thousands of nucleic acid molecules , \n these quantities have been studied by the life sciences community to investigate a range of biological problems . \n since the rna abundance can change according to a wide range of perturbations , this makes it the molecule of choice for exploring biological systems ; its instability , on the other hand , could be an underestimated source of technical variability . we found that a large fraction of the rna abundance originally present in the biological system prior to extraction was masked by the rna labeling and measurement procedure . \n the method used to extract rna molecules from cells and to label them prior to hybridization operations on dna arrays affects the original distribution of rna . \n only if rna measurements are performed according to the same procedure can biological information be inferred from the assay read out .

", " purposewe investigated the feasibility of glaucoma detection by measuring retinal surface contour variability ( rscv ) using optical coherence tomography ( oct).methodsthe peripapillary region in one eye of each participant was scanned over an 8  8 mm area with a swept source oct prototype . \n the retinal surface contour was sampled at approximately 1.5- to 3.5-mm radius circles centered on the optic nerve head . \n the rscv is defined as the average log value within a middle spatial frequency band of the fourier transform to the elevation profile of the inner retinal surface . \n the spatial frequency band was optimized to distinguish glaucoma from normal . \n nerve fiber layer thickness ( nflt ) was sampled around a 1.7-mm radius circle . \n glaucoma severity was assessed by automated static perimetry.resultswe enrolled 17 glaucomatous eyes and 17 healthy eyes . \n a great majority of the glaucoma group were in the early stage ( visual field mean deviation average 2.48  3.73 db ) . \n significant differences were found for rscv between glaucoma and control eyes ( p < 0.003 ) at all radii . \n the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( aroc = 0.90 ) of rscv was best at the 3.5-mm radius . \n this was not significantly better than nflt ( aroc = 0.84 ) . with the 99% specificity , \n the glaucoma detection sensitivity was 53% for rscv and 29% for nflt \n ( p = 0.13).conclusionsretinal surface contour variability was significantly increased in glaucoma patients . \n the diagnostic accuracy of rscv was equal to nflt in early glaucoma . \n since the rscv detects small - scale focal damage and the average nflt measures global damage , they provide different diagnostic information that may be synergistic . ", " retained intraocular graphite foreign bodies are uncommon . \n although they are generally inert , they have been reported to cause severe inflammatory reaction and progressive damage to intraocular structures . \n we report a case of a six - year - old girl with a retained intraocular graphite pencil lead foreign body in the anterior chamber of the eye and discuss the various considerations in the management of such cases . ", " one of the room temperature ionic liquids ( rtils ) , 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ( [ bmim]cl ) was chosen to prepare the concentrated solutions of polyacrylonitrile ( pan ) . \n the rheological behaviors of the solutions were measured with rotational rheometry under different conditions , including temperatures , concentration , and molecular weight of pan . \n the solutions exhibited shear - thinning behaviors , similar to that of pan / dmf solutions . \n the viscosities decreased with the increasing of shear rates . \n however , the viscosity decreased sharply at high shear rates when the concentration was up to 16wt% . \n the dependence of the viscosity on temperature was analyzed through the determination of the apparent activation energy . \n unusually , the viscosity of solutions of higher concentration is lower than that of lower concentration . \n similarly , the viscosity of low molecular weight pan was higher than high molecular weight pan at high shear rates . \n the dynamic rheological measurement indicates the loss modulus is much higher than storage modulus . \n the trend of complex viscosity is similar with the result of static rheological measurement . \n the interaction between pan and ionic liquid [ bmim]cl was discussed . ", " we report two cases of esophagobronchial fistulae diagnosed by multi - detector computed tomography ( mdct ) oral contrast swallow examination . \n it is helpful to supplement the ct study with an oral contrast swallow as it aids in confirmation of a suspected fistula and also demonstrates the fistula tract better . \n we present the clinical details and the imaging findings on mdct of two cases of esophagobronchial fistulae  one secondary to chronic chest tuberculosis and the other secondary to a squamous cell carcinoma of the upper esophagus  followed by discussion of the etiology , pathogenesis , and imaging of these fistulae . ", " most guidelines for clinical practice , and especially those for the construction of decision support tools , assume that the individual person ( the patient ) needs to be in possession of information of particular sorts and amount in order to qualify as having made an  \n informed decision. this often implicitly segues into the patient having made a  \n good decision. in person - centred health care , whether , in what form , and with what weight ,  information is included as a criterion of decision quality is a matter for the person involved , to decide in the light of their own values , preferences , and time and resource constraints . ", " high - grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( panin-3 ) is recognized as a precursor lesion of invasive ductal carcinoma ( idc ) . \n however , histological evidence that panin-3 invades beyond the basement membrane of pancreatic ductal epithelium , that is , the moment panin-3 becomes idc , has not been captured yet . \n this may be because panins which are microscopic papillary or flat lesion rarely develop clinical symptoms and are not detectable on imaging examination . \n on the other hand , most idcs were found in the advanced stage with massive invasion . in this report \n , panin-3 obstructed several branch pancreatic ducts and subsequently caused pancreatitis which developed clinical symptom and was detectable as a pancreatic mass in imaging studies . \n a 65-year - old woman was referred to our institution for further examination of her repeated pancreatitis . \n abdominal ultrasound revealed a low echoic mass of 13 mm in diameter in the pancreatic body without upstream dilatation of the main pancreatic duct ( mpd ) . \n endoscopic retrograde pancreatography showed a strictured segment of 2 mm in length in the mpd at the pancreatic body . \n cytological examination of pancreatic juice revealed adenocarcinoma and distal pancreatectomy was performed . \n a resected specimen revealed a whitish mass of 15 mm in diameter in the pancreatic body , which was identified as pancreatitis by histological examination . \n papillary growth of panin-3 was seen mainly in the branch ducts . \n each panin-3 was located separately in the branch ducts with normal epithelia in the mpd between them . in three adjacent branch ducts , \n panin-3 was observed to be invading microscopically beyond the basement membrane . ", " ductal adenocarcinoma is an unusual variant of adenocarcinoma of the prostate . \n a 73-year - old male was referred to our hospital for the further examination of an elevated prostate - specific antigen level of 23.4 ng / ml . \n radical prostatectomy ( rp ) was performed based on the diagnosis obtained by a prostate needle biopsy . \n the rp specimen revealed ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate with positive capsular penetration . \n we herein report a rare case of ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate . ", " the novottf-100a device emits alternating tumor treating electric fields ( ttfields ) that interfere with cytokinesis and chromosome segregation during mitosis . \n because it has a similar efficacy to cytotoxic chemotherapy , the device has been approved by the united states food and drug administration for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma . \n although bevacizumab has been in use for recurrent glioblastoma , patients who experience incomplete or no response to bevacizumab may be predisposed to early bevacizumab treatment failure . \n however , the addition of ttfields therapy may augment the efficacy from bevacizumab . \n we report a patient with recurrent cystic glioblastoma who received add - on ttfields therapy due to an incomplete response to single - agent bevacizumab . \n after 6 cycles of therapy , a resolution of cystic enhancement was noted , together with reduction of the tumor cyst and resolution of most of the cerebral edema in the surrounding brain . \n however , the patient also suffered from relapsed disease at locations distant from the original glioblastoma and the corresponding radiation fields received at initial diagnosis . \n we conclude that combination ttfields and bevacizumab therapy is safe and may be efficacious for patients with recurrent glioblastoma . \n a further study would be needed to determine the relapse pattern and the distribution of the electric fields in the brain . ", " the effect of aloe vera on the reduction of plaque and gingivitis was evaluated in a randomized , parallel and double - blind clinical trial . \n subjects were randomly allocated to the test group ( n=15 )  dentifrice containing aloe vera - or the control group ( n=15 )  fluoridated dentifrice . plaque index ( pi ) and gingival bleeding index ( gbi ) \n were assessed at days 0 and 30 . \n subjects were asked to brush their teeth with the control or test dentifrice , three times a day , during a 30-day period . \n there was a significant reduction on plaque and gingivitis in both groups , but no statistically significant difference was observed among them ( p>0.01 ) . \n the dentifrice containing aloe vera did not show any additional effect on plaque and gingivitis control compared to the fluoridated dentifrice . ", " primary mucinous carcinoma of the skin is a rare adnexal tumor of sweat gland origin . \n a case report is presented of a 70-year - old male , who presented with a slow growing mass near the lateral canthus of his left eye . \n the case was clinically diagnosed as a fibroma . \n an excisional biopsy of the lesion revealed mucinous carcinoma of the skin . \n investigations excluded the possibility of metastatic mucinous carcinoma . \n thus , the lesion in the lateral canthus region was diagnosed as primary mucinous carcinoma of the skin , a rare site of occurrence . ", " a 66-year - old man underwent computed tomography - guided needle biopsy of a suspicious renal mass . \n two months later he underwent partial nephrectomy . \n histology revealed a 30-mm clear cell renal cell carcinoma , up to fuhrman grade 3 . \n an area of the capsule was interrupted , which corresponded to a hemorrhagic area on the cortical surface . under microscopy \n , this area showed a tongue of tumor tissue protruding through the renal capsule . \n a tumor deposit was found in the perinephric fat . \n these features suggest that tumor seeding may have occurred during the needle biopsy . ", " adding small fractions of cholesterol \n decreases the interfacial \n viscosity of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine ( dppc ) monolayers by an \n order of magnitude per wt % . \n grazing incidence x - ray diffraction shows \n that cholesterol at these small fractions does not mix ideally with \n dppc but rather induces nanophase separated structures of an ordered , \n primarily dppc phase bordered by a line - active , disordered , mixed \n dppc - cholesterol phase . \n we propose that the free area in the classic \n cohen and turnbull model of viscosity is inversely proportional to \n the number of molecules in the coherence area , or product of the two \n coherence lengths . \n cholesterol significantly reduces the coherence \n area of the crystals as well as the interfacial viscosity . using this \n free area collapses the surface viscosity data for all surface pressures \n and cholesterol fractions to a universal logarithmic relation . \n the \n extent of molecular coherence appears to be a fundamental factor in \n determining surface viscosity in ordered monolayers . ", " abstractbackgroundthe centralization of human activities is associated with different pollutants which enter into environment easily and cause the urban environment more vulnerable . regarding the importance of air pollution issue for tehran metropolis , many plans and regulations have been developed . however , most of them failed to decline the pollution . \n the purpose of this study was to pathologically analyze air - pollution control plans to offer effective solutions for tehran metropolis.methodsa qualitative content analysis in addition to a semi - structured interview with 14 practicing professional were used to identify 1 ) key sources of tehran s air pollution , 2 ) recognize challenges towards effective performance of pertinent plans and 3 ) , offer effective solutions.resultsrelated challenges to air - pollution control plans can be divided into two major categories including lack of integrated and organized stewardship and pest challenges.conclusionfor controlling the air pollution of tehran effectively , various controlling alternatives were identified as systematization of plan preparation process , standardization and utilization of new technologies & experts , infrastructural development , realization of social justice , developing coordination mechanisms , improving citizens participatory capacity and focusing on effective management of fuel and energy.controlling air pollution in tehran needs a serious attention of policymakers to make enforcements through applying a systemic cycle of preparation comprehensive plans . \n further , implement the enforcements and evaluate the environmental impact of the plans through involving all stakeholders . ", " chiari malformation type i ( cm - i ) related to syndromic craniosynostosis in pediatric patients has been well - studied . \n the surgical management consists of cranial vault remodeling with or without posterior fossa decompression . \n there were also cases , in whom cm - i was diagnosed prior to the craniosynostosis in early childhood . \n we present a 16-year - old boy who admitted with symptoms related to cm - i . with careful examination and further genetic investigations , \n a diagnosis of crouzon syndrome was made , of which the patient and his family was unaware before . \n the patient underwent surgery for posterior fossa decompression and followed - up for crouzon 's syndrome . to our knowledge , this is the only case report indicating a late adolescent diagnosis of crouzon syndrome through clinical symptoms of an associated cm - i . ", " the risk of permanent hypoparathyroidism following thyroid and parathyroid surgery is around 1% in the hands of experienced endocrine surgeons .   \n although this complication is rare , rendering a patient permanently aparathyroid has significant consequences on the health and quality of life of the patient . \n immediate autotransplantation of parathyroid glands that are injured or unintentionally removed offers the best possibility of graft viability and functionality . \n however , since the majority of cases of hypoparathyroidism are transient , immediate autotransplantation can complicate postoperative surveillance in certain patients , especially those with primary hyperparathyroidism .   \n cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue is an alternate technique that was developed to treat patients with permanent hypoparathyroidism . \n this method allows for parathyroid tissue to be stored and then autotransplanted in a delayed fashion once permanent hypoparathyroidism is confirmed . \n this article provides a contemporary review on cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue and its current role in thyroid and parathyroid surgery . ", " in this article , the authors estimate a multiple - output cost function for a sample of 2,235 hospitals during the period 1984 - 88 to disaggregate total costs into inpatient and outpatient components . \n the results suggest that outpatient cost growth is roughly proportional to that of inpatient cost , despite much higher relative growth in revenues and utilization on the outpatient side . \n the stability in the outpatient / inpatient cost ratio implies that the increase in the outpatient - to - inpatient utilization ratio was offset by a decline in their relative unit costs . ", " backgroundwilms tumor ( wt ) is the most common malignant renal tumor in children . \n previous studies suggested the reversion - inducing , cysteine - rich protein with kazal motifs ( reck ) down - regulation might have a role in numerous human cancers . \n the current study was done to investigate the associations of reck single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) with the wt susceptibility in chinese children.material/methodswe analyzed 2 snps ( rs10972727and rs11788747 ) in a total of 97 wt children and 194 healthy matched controls ( 1:2 ratio ) by real - time pcr and pcr - rflp genotyping analysis.resultswe found that the g allele of rs11788747 in the reck gene was significantly associated with wt in chinese children ( or=0.7 , 95% ci : 0.450.99 ; p=0.042 ) ; as with another snp rs10972727 , however , no statistically significant difference was detected . \n further analysis showed there was also a statistically significant difference in genotype frequencies between terminal tumor stage ( p=0.026 ) and metastatic groups ( p=0.002).conclusionsthe present data indicate that there is a significant association between mutant g of rs11788747 in reck and wt risk . \n g carriers with advanced tumor stage or with metastasis might have an increased risk of wt .
